"""Field projections for the fusion_triage flow — both cyber paths and the IMU normalization.

Two cyber paths feed the SAME field contract:

- `soc_action_from_level` — the DECIDABLE projection, used by the month-scale census where
  calling an adjudicator per alert is neither viable nor needed. Its constants are not invented
  here: 12 is the triage flow's own containment edge (`rule_level >= 12` -> stage_containment),
  7 is that flow's triage floor, and the fallback mirrors the escalation-default. Artifacts fed
  by this path must say so.
- `soc_action_from_verdict` — the adjudicator path, for any decision source that emits a
  `recommended_action`: only that field is consumed, and anything missing or out-of-vocabulary
  clamps to "watch" (escalation-default, never silent-benign).

The IMU side normalizes the sensor bridge's NDJSON rows (`prismpath-hw/bridge/field_bridge.py`)
across the observed schema drift: session1 predates the `dev_mg` field and uses the raw
stability-classifier label "On Table"; later sessions emit canonical labels and native dev_mg.
