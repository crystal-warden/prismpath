"""Self-heal contract, pinned:
  * a lost block is a detected gap;
  * a forged or corrupted block is REJECTED (fails its Merkle proof), never silently accepted;
  * selective retransmission fills exactly the gaps and reassembles the original stream bit-for-bit
    (verified through the codec round-trip);
  * an unrecoverable block stays a PROVABLE gap — assemble() refuses rather than emit a silent hole.
