# adapters/telemetry · decision-preserving telemetry

A bounded adapter that turns a decidable flow's telemetry into the **minimum sufficient statistic for its
decisions**, entropy-codes it on a **self framing Fibonacci wire**, and makes delivery **self healing and
Merkle-verified**: compression and integrity both derived from, and provably faithful to, the routing
decision. Additive, arch-guard-isolated, zero core changes.

The full design of record lives off-repo (the determination doc); only material backed by something that
runs lands here.

## Status · Phase A ✅ · Phase B ✅ · Phase C partial (C1 + C3 landed)
- ✅ **Zeckendorf / Fibonacci codec** (`zeckendorf.py`); the self framing wire. Every code ends in a
  unique `11`, so a stream is zero-header and self-delimiting; small integers are tiny (`1->11`,
  `2->011`), which is where delta-differenced telemetry lives. Round-trip + framing invariants under test.
- ✅ **Decision-preserving quantizer** (`quantizer.py`); extracts each field's `field OP const`
  thresholds from the flow and maps a reading to the **coarsest symbol that still resolves every routing
  decision** (minimum sufficient statistic). `quantize` → `reconstruct` routes identically across
  numeric / boolean / categorical fields; symbols are tiny.
- ✅ **Decisions-preserved conformance test** (`wire.py` + `conformance/decisions.json`); the
  differentiated proof, frozen: 4 flows × 55 boundary-probing readings, each tagged with its
  full-precision route at every decision node. The corpus is replayed two ways; the engine must
  reproduce the frozen routes (drift guard), and the **wire round-trip** (quantize → Fibonacci-code →
  decode → reconstruct) must route to the same target at every node (decision preservation, end to end
  through the real codec). Regenerate with `gen_decisions_corpus.py`.
- ✅ **Go/no-go benchmarks** (`bench/`, results in `bench/results.md`); **PASS**. Two sets: a codec
  bake-off and a parametric sweep (value regime × stream scale to 100k + Gilbert-Elliott retransmission).
  Findings: `delta+zz+fib` beats the streaming baselines ~2 to 3× (batch compressors win on a buffered block
  but aren't self-framing/line-rate); decision preserving quantization is **magnitude-independent**: on a
  wide-range field with few thresholds it holds ~2 bits/reading while raw scales with magnitude (~16× vs
  fixed); ratios **converge** by N=10k to 100k (a too-small test would have undersold it; the sweep proves
  it); selective MMR retransmit is multiples cheaper under sparse burst loss. **Margins hold → Phase A
  validates.**
- ✅ **On a real wire (cross-adapter check)**: the self framing property this codec rests on is
  measured on a real transport by [`adapters/fusion/bench/wire.py`](../fusion/bench/wire.py), which
  charges per packet IP/TCP/TLS framing over the full SIEM backlog and recorded IMU sessions. The
  payoff is exactly the self framing one: unbatched, a per decision packet is header bound (110
  B/decision), but because the codec carries no per record framing the header amortizes to ~0 when a
  packet holds many readings (MTU-fill → **1.6 B/decision**), and the advantage persists **~45×** vs
  uncompressed batched JSON. Stated honestly: against *zstd-batched* JSON it is a wash on pure bytes;
  the win there is tamper evidence, per reading streamability, no decompression, and decidability, not
  raw size. An optional AEAD + X25519-ECDHE confidentiality layer is measured on top (~0.035
  B/decision when batched). Single-stream (N=1) baseline; the multi-source scaling claim is a stated
  hypothesis, not yet measured. See supporting-evidence #86.

### Phase B ✅
- ✅ **Self-heal core** (`selfheal.py`); the Fibonacci stream is chunked into Merkle committed blocks,
  reusing the repo's **real** Merkle primitive (`prismpath.ledger_ots`; `audit_log`'s open-release MMR is
  a stub, so this is the genuine one; batch-per-epoch, OTS-anchorable). A lost block is a detected gap; a
  **forged or corrupted block is rejected** (its inclusion proof fails against the trusted root), never
  silently accepted; selective retransmission fills exactly the gaps and reassembles the stream
  bit-for-bit; an unrecoverable block stays a **provable** gap (`assemble()` refuses a silent hole).
- ✅ **Chained epochs + retention** (`epochs.py`); each sealed window's Merkle root chains to the
  previous (`H(prev‖merkle)`), so a tiny permanent chain of roots gives total ordering + tamper evidence
  across time while only recent epochs keep raw data. Retention: **drop-on-ACK** (verified up to a root →
  forget the bytes, keep the root), a **retention cap**, and a **provable pressure-drop** (un-acked data
  forced out by the cap is a named gap, never a silent hole). Chain verifies after any drop; sealed roots
  are OTS-anchorable via `ledger_ots`.
- ✅ **Authenticated ACK channel** (`ackchannel.py`); drop-on-ACK is gated behind an HMAC-SHA256 tag
  over (high-water root, monotonic seq) with a secret shared out-of-band (the pattern `guard_ledger`
  uses). The edge drops only for an ACK that verifies **and** advances the sequence; a forged, tampered,
  wrong-secret, or replayed ACK is ignored and **drops nothing**: closing the data-loss-by-spoof hole
  the doc flags.
- ✅ **Human-readable inspect path** (`decode.py`); `python decode.py --flow <flow.md> --bits <stream>`
  decodes a captured bitstream back to each reading's symbols, reconstructed values, and the **routing
  decision** the policy makes on it. The `.md` is the decoder (it defines both the partition and the
  routing), so opaque wire traffic is debuggable without bespoke, drifting tooling. Standalone (no core
  change); a `prismpath decode` CLI alias would be a one-liner in `cli.py`.

### Phase C (partial)
- ✅ **Word-packed wire** (`packed.py`); the real byte format: Fibonacci bits accumulated MSB-first into
  64-bit words, final word zero-padded; the self framing makes the pad a droppable partial frame, so the
  round-trip is exact with no carried bit-count. Measured padding overhead amortizes from ~39% at N=10 to
  **~0% by N=100k** (the doc's "~3 to 7%" only bites at tiny streams). Nails the format + correctness; the
  ~10 to 20× throughput is the C/FPGA path (C2).
- ✅ **Tier-6 decision-first spiral packing** (`spiral.py`, gate in `bench/spiral_bench.py`); packs a
  multi-var reading onto a Fermat/Vogel spiral whose contiguous index ranges **are** the routes, so the
  wire carries a single **band ID** ("transmit the decision, not the magnitude"); band membership is
  `base ≤ n < base+width`; an integer compare, the Level M atom (`r²=c²·n` ⇒ a radial ring *is* `n < K`).
  Baseline sits at the dense center, severe branches outward; Gray-within-band gives on-demand fidelity
  (progressive). All continuous math (√, golden angle in degrees) is build-time; the edge path is integer
  table + compare. **Gate PASS** (`bench/spiral_results.md`): on multi-dim correlated telemetry the band
  ID routes correctly at **1.9×/2.8×/3.6× fewer bits** than the linear per field wire for k=2/3/4 (no win
  at k=1; scalars stay on the layer-2 quantizer, as intended), fidelity parity holds (progressive ≈1×
  linear, so the win is progressiveness not dropped data), correlation makes the decision stream cheaper,
  and the one decision frame survives burst loss better than *k* frames. Frozen `conformance/spiral.json`
  (a mapping bug turns a test RED) + a decisions-preserved proof re-routing each probe three ways.
- **C2 partial**: the C encoder is built and measured on four MCU instruction sets, verified byte
  for byte against the reference before timing (`prismpath-hw/codec-bench/`, evidence #104); the
  FPGA shift register half and C4 optional turbovec-VQ remain unbuilt.

## Try it on your own events (`preflight.py` and `prismpath-preflight`)
One command answers the adoption question before you touch a Vector config: point it at a policy flow
and a sample of your real events (NDJSON), and it reports the derived codebook, how many events encode
cleanly and exactly why the rest do not (missing fields, unmapped nested paths, values a partition
cannot place, float truncation), the projected bytes per event next to your raw JSON, and how your
traffic distributes over the flow's routes. Every encodable event is replayed through the full round
trip (quantize, Fibonacci-code, decode, reconstruct) and checked to route **identically** to the
original at every decision node, so decision preservation is verified on *your* data. Semantics match
the Vector codec exactly (`--map` = `field_paths`, `--on-missing` = `on_missing`, one byte-aligned
reading per frame). Exit 0 only when nothing needs attention, so it drops straight into CI. `--privacy` adds a measured privacy audit: each field's reconstruction bound (how precisely a raw value is recoverable from its cell) and, for fusion policies, how many joint input cells produce each verdict (a verdict made by many input cells hides its inputs; one made by a single cell pins them).
```
python adapters/telemetry/preflight.py <flow.md> <sample.ndjson> \
    [--map FIELD=json.dot.path] [--on-missing error|skip] [--route-node N] [--privacy] [--json report.json]
```

The tool ships as deliberate twins with one contract (same flags, same report sections, same JSON
schema, same exit codes). The Python one above runs on the **reference implementation**, stock
Python, no build. The Rust one (`prismpath-preflight/`, in the workspace) runs on the **same crates
the Vector codec is built from**, so its report is what the codec will do by construction; it is
also where the Rust value model's own behavior surfaces (a non-numeric string on a numeric field
is COERCED TO 0 by the crates, where the reference errors; the Rust tool flags it and withholds
READY). Running both on one sample is a free differential test of the whole stack; on the clean
corpus their JSON reports are identical.
```
cargo install prismpath-preflight        # published on crates.io
prismpath-preflight <flow.md> <sample.ndjson> [same flags]
```
(or `cargo run -q -p prismpath-preflight -- ...` from this repo without installing)

## Migrate from a Vector config you already run (`facet_init.py`)
Your Vector routes ARE your codebook. `facet_init.py` reads a `vector.toml`, transcribes every
route and filter condition that is expressible in Level M (`field OP const` under and/or/not, plus
`includes([..], .field)` as `in`) into a DRAFT flow, chains the transforms into nodes, maps nested
event paths to codec `field_paths`, and then verifies the draft end to end through `preflight.py`
on your sample. What does not transcribe (function calls, regex, VRL variables, field vs field,
null, float thresholds) is reported verbatim with the reason for the author to resolve. **No
condition is ever learned from the sample**: the codebook must derive from authored policy, so the
tool drafts and the author signs; the banner in the emitted file says exactly that, and notes that
Vector's route transform fans out to every match while a flow edge routes first match. Without
`--vector-toml` it emits a skeleton annotated with the discovered fields and writes no conditions
at all.
```
python adapters/telemetry/facet_init.py <sample.ndjson> \
    [--vector-toml vector.toml] [--out DRAFT.flow.md] [--name NAME] [--no-check]
```

## Roadmap (phased, benchmark-gated)
- **Phase A** ✅; quantizer + codec + decisions-preserved test + go/no-go benchmarks (margins hold).
- **Phase B** ✅; self heal via the repo's real Merkle (`ledger_ots`) + selective retransmission +
  OTS-anchored chained-epoch retention + authenticated ACK + the decode/inspect path.
- **Phase C**: word-packed wire ✅; Tier-6 spiral spatial packing ✅ (benchmark PASS); FPGA
  shift-register codec; optional turbovec-VQ.

## Honest scope
Benchmark-gated (if the compression, retransmission, or routing-accuracy margins don't hold, it stops
cheaply). Resilience and performance are validated under **stated channel models** (e.g. Gilbert-Elliott
burst-loss) on real sensor data and real edge silicon; never claimed as field-/orbit-proven.

## Tests
```
python -m pytest adapters/telemetry
