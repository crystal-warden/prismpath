# Architecture

PrismPath is layered so the **engine stays platform agnostic** and everything target specific
lives behind one plugin interface. Two layers, one seam.

## 1. The flow kernel

A pure, dependency light core that turns a markdown file into a routed agent run.

```
parser.py ──▶ Graph ──▶ engine.run(graph, agent, router) ──▶ RunResult
                              │
                              ├─ predicates.py   safe `when` evaluator (deterministic edges)
                              └─ router.py       Embedding / LLM / Hybrid (semantic edges)
                                     └─ embedder.py (bge), llm_local.py (LLM fallback)
```

- **`parser.py`**: `## heading` → node; `-> target: condition` → edge; YAML front matter (`name`,
  `start`); terminal detection (a node with no outgoing edges).
- **`predicates.py`**: evaluates `when <expr>` over the agent's structured outcome. **No calls,
  attribute access, or subscripts** are permitted in an expression, so a `when` clause can never
  execute arbitrary code.
- **`router.py`**: resolves semantic edges. `HybridRouter` embeds the outcome against each edge
  condition and only escalates to a 1 shot LLM when the top 1↔top 2 margin is below `margin`.
- **`engine.py`**: at each node: evaluate deterministic edges in document order (first true wins);
  if none match, hand the semantic edges to the router. Records a `StepLog` per transition
  (`info["used"]` ∈ `{deterministic, embed, llm, single, semantic}`).

The kernel knows nothing about sprints, gates, or build targets.

### The portable kernels: one spec, four implementations

The decidable subset of the kernel is reimplemented, dependency free, in three more languages:
JavaScript ([`portable/prismpath.mjs`](../../prismpath/portable/prismpath.mjs), browser/edge/Node), Rust
(`prismpath-rs/`, native + WASM), and Go (`prismpath-go/`), each certified against the frozen
conformance vectors ([`portable/conformance/`](../../prismpath/portable/conformance/README.md): 1,079 predicate
cases + 27 engine fixtures, bit for bit). The Python kernel stays the reference (vectors are
generated from it); the ports are runtime surfaces, and the tooling (validate/verify/test/lock/
ci-report/lsp) deliberately lives only on the reference side: an asymmetry, not a gap.

## 2. The control plane

`run_sprint.py` is the loop that drives a real agent swarm to build a real tree against a gate.

```
              SPRINT_NUDGE / spec                 (human intent)
                      │
        ┌─────────────▼──────────────┐
        │  critic                     │  reviews the build, picks the next unit of work or says DONE
        └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                      │  + RAG grounding (retriever.py, index from the active plugin)
        ┌─────────────▼──────────────┐
        │  executor                   │  edit the REAL tree: cecli diff-edit / swarm_runner / served model
        └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                      │
        ┌─────────────▼──────────────┐
        │  GATE  (the seam)           │  validate(proj) -> {valid, errs, oversized, ...}
        │  browser: gates.py          │  compiles? types? builds? tests? wired? reachable?
        │  other:   plugin.validate   │
        └─────────────┬──────────────┘
            green → commit unit, advance        red ×3 same error → escalate:
                                                  frontier auto-unblock (SPRINT_AGY) → human HELP.md
```

Supporting services:

- **`orchestrator.py`**: a FastAPI front for a chat UI: `planning → awaiting_approval → executing →
  done`, streaming build status over SSE; on approval it launches `run_sprint.py` as a subprocess.
- **`mission_control.py`**: a loopback only console (`127.0.0.1`) that autodiscovers live sprints,
  can start/stop/pause them, and records an append only **action log** (`audit_log.py`).
- **`swarm_runner.py`**: `make_swarm_agent(spec, backend="auto")` returns a PrismPath agent backed by
  the real swarm, falling back to `llm_local` when no backend is up.
- **`retriever.py`**: dense retrieval over a turbovec docs index to ground the coder in real APIs.
  The engine is index agnostic; the path comes from the active gate plugin's `RAG_INDEX`.

### The roles and build modes

The loop is a **5 role pipeline** with hard boundaries: an **architect** designs a `BLUEPRINT.md` (file
manifest + port contracts, no code), a **coder** implements one critic chosen feature per turn, a
**test author** owns the headless specs, the **gate** validates deterministically, a **fixer** makes the
smallest change to pass it, and a **critic** reviews quality and blueprint adherence, then picks the next
step or says DONE. Two build modes:

- **`spec`** (`SPRINT_SPEC_ORDER`): build a flat list of module files, each from its embedded spec.
- **`kg`** (`SPRINT_KG`): the most deterministic. One structured spec becomes an authored knowledge graph;
  build exactly one node per pass (the first `pending` whose `depends_on` are all `done`), embedding only
  that requirement plus the glossary, named specs, and what's already built.

## 3. The seam: the gate plugin interface

`SPRINT_GATE` (and `ORCH_TARGET`) selects the target. `"browser"` is built in (`gates.py`); any other
value resolves via `plugins/load_gate(name)` to an optional plugin. **This is the only place a target's
specifics live**, extractable to a standalone package/image. A plugin module exposes:

| attribute | purpose |
|---|---|
| `validate(proj) -> dict` | the gate: `{valid, errs, oversized, biggest_file, ...}` |
| `HAS_SPEC_LAYER` | whether the gate runs unit specs the test author owns |
| `ARCH_PATH` | the architecture contract file injected into builder prompts |
| `LESSONS_PATH` | hard won target lessons injected into the coder |
| `RAG_INDEX` | the docs vector index for grounding (or unset) |
| `FILE_EXTS` | source extensions the engine collects |
| `SOURCE_DIRS` / `KG_SOURCE_DIRS` / `CORE_DIR` / `ENTRY_FILES` | project **layout** the coder edits ("focus") |
| `SPEC_SUFFIXES` / `TESTABLE_DIRS` | how the test author detects specs and headlessly exercisable modules |
| `PLANNER_NOTE` | appended to the planner's system prompt (orchestrator) |
| `BUILD_RULES` / `BUILD_RULES_SPEC` | target build discipline injected into the coder |

The engine reads these through `getattr` with safe defaults, so with **no plugin** (the browser path)
it degrades to an empty, layout agnostic configuration and runs entirely on the built in gate. A
gate plugin is any module exposing this table's attributes (discovered via `plugins/registry.py`).

> Design property: because the seam is a narrow ports/adapters boundary, adding a build target is a
> new plugin module, not a change to the engine.
