# PrismPath FRAMEWORK: the operating methodology

How PrismPath's control plane directs an AI-swarm project, distilled from a real spec-driven build. The
thesis: a human holds the VISION, that vision is compiled into **one spec per script**, and a local-LLM
swarm builds each spec as a **feature sprint** against deterministic **gates**, driven by a **5-role
pipeline** (architect, coder, test author, gate, fixer, critic) in which the critic picks the next step.

> The concrete examples below (a `PRODUCT_DESIGN.md` umbrella, core modules, a `WidgetDef` drift, a
> client layer) come from the **reference project**, an app built under a target gate plugin.
> The methodology and every lesson are target-agnostic; only the examples are app-flavored.

## The pipeline
```
VISION (human, in conversation)
   → UMBRELLA design doc (PRODUCT_DESIGN.md): the cohering whole; narrative, loops, pillars, the ONE ironclad contract
   → SPEC PER SCRIPT (specs/<Module>.md): purpose, types/contract, behavior, deps, ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
   → FEATURE SPRINTS (prismpath swarm): the critic picks the next step; cecli diff edits the real tree to green
   → GATES dispose; the CRITIC directs; human supervises the hard parts
   → working, then iterate
```

## Why spec-per script (not one mega-doc, not blank-slate)
- A swarm builds a **module** well when it has a tight, self-contained contract. One file = one spec = one
  sprint keeps the prompt small and the acceptance criteria checkable.
- This is a **FEATURE-sprint** engine, not a blank-slate generator. It excels at *extending a base*
  (the reference build had ~30 systems + a working hub before feature sprints began). Blank-slate
  produces breadth without a spine; specs-against-a-base produce depth that integrates. Establish a
  thin working base FIRST, then spec-driven feature sprints.

## The components and their jobs
- **The 5 role pipeline (separated roles, hard boundaries):** no role grades its own work. The
  **architect** designs a `BLUEPRINT.md` (file manifest + port contracts, no code); the **coder**
  implements one critic chosen feature per turn (no tests, no self grading); the **test author** owns the
  headless specs (never touches impl); the **gate** validates deterministically; the **fixer** makes the
  smallest change to satisfy the gate (conforms code to the specs, never edits them); the **critic**
  reviews quality, architecture, and blueprint adherence, then picks the next step or says DONE. Lean each
  role's context (goal + coverage + file list, not the whole architecture); the served model runs the
  roles as gemma4/qwen25 voices.
- **cecli (executor):** diff edits the REAL tree to green (no whole file regen, so no require scrambling).
- **Gates = the DEFINITION OF DONE, machine enforced** (the key discovery): a build is not green until it
  *compiles + types + builds + tests + is wired + is reachable by the user*. Declare an
  invariant in the spec → confirm it with a gate, never with prose alone (`wiring_check`,
  `presentation_check`, plus whatever invariants your target demands). "Never write a completeness
  claim a gate doesn't enforce."
- **Auditor (qwen, idle time judge):** a consistency reviewer that, after each build, checks the changed file
  against a canonical `GLOSSARY.md` and flags contract drift (a type/field/signature named differently than
  the glossary mandates). It runs on the otherwise idle qwen25 coder in its window between gemma4 builds, so
  it's nearly free. ADVISORY, not a gate (an LLM judge is fuzzy): it surfaces drift candidates a human or a
  follow up deterministic check confirms. The glossary is what makes a small model reliable here: focused
  conformance to an explicit contract is a 7B's sweet spot. Opt in via `SPRINT_AUDIT=1`.
- **Human as supervisor:** answers HELP escalations, and HAND BUILDS the parts the swarm genuinely can't
  (client/UI, composition root wiring, the usable storefront): "agents propose, gates dispose,
  Claude unblocks the hard parts."

## Hard won operating lessons (so far)
- **Lean each role's context.** A 14KB prompt across several sequential role dispatches makes a round that
  looks hung. Pass what the decision needs, nothing more (~5s dispatches).
- **Oversized auto refactor is a footgun.** Inlining a whole file into one LLM dispatch to "split" it hangs
  and corrupts mid feature. Make size a *soft, advisory* signal; do structure work deliberately on green.
- **The model server clogs under hours of load** (orphaned long generations starve throughput on unified
  memory); restart to clear, and keep `gpu-memory-utilization` modest on a workstation you're using. But
  DIAGNOSE before restarting the server: a fresh 16 token probe returning in ~2s means the server is FINE and
  the slowness is elsewhere (build size / retry count), not a clog.
- **Cap retries to the build's COST, or a fixable RED becomes an infinite spin.** cecli `--max-reflections 5`
  × a slow large context build = a ~20 min `CECLI_TIMEOUT` *per iteration*. If the RED is one the model can't
  self fix (here: an adapter missing a field the linter had added to its port type),
  every iteration burns all 5 reflections → times out → restarts → spins forever, surfacing to the human as
  "cecli timeouts." Fail FAST (reflections=3 ≈ 10 min) and let the **3×-same error auto stuck detector ESCALATE
  to the human**, who hand fixes the one hard edit and the swarm flows again. Retry budget must be < timeout ÷
  per attempt cost, with margin.
- **Surface rounds edit the WIRING, so their builds are big and brittle.** Touching the composition root
  + adapters + the port `Types` per round pulls a large focus into one cecli call (slow) and is where
  port/adapter type mismatches surface (the port spin above). Worth scoping the surface round focus
  tighter, or accepting that these are the rounds most likely to need a human unblock.
- **Drift is preventable with gates, not vigilance.** Dead modules, an unbuilt surface, an unreachable one,
  a stale blueprint: each becomes a gate or an auto refresh, not a thing you remember to check.
- **The blueprint is a CONTRACT, not a status doc**: structural + behavioral expectations only; priorities
  and current state are derived live (a red gate IS the priority), never authored into the contract.
- **Parallel spec authors DRIFT: author a SHARED GLOSSARY first.** Fanning out one agent per module spec is
  fast, but each independently invents names for the *cross references* (Elements exported `ValueKey`; PetGems
  & Towers wrote `ValueId`/`EffectKey`; `damageMultiplier` scalar vs array; `EnemyDef` vs `EnemyDefinition`;
  `element` vs `elements`; chimera union SUM vs MAX). 10 specs → ~15 hard mismatches that would each be a build
  failure. THE FIX: author a `GLOSSARY.md` of canonical shared types + signatures FIRST, pass it to every spec
  agent as ground truth, and run a consistency agent after. This is the whole value of spec driven: drift is
  caught + reconciled at the CHEAP (markdown) layer, never as expensive broken code. (Cost ~$0 to fix a name in
  a spec; a wrong type name discovered mid sprint costs a stuck swarm.)
- **The GLOSSARY is authored in PASSES, and the last mile is the HUMAN's.** You can guess the shared NAMES up
  front, but you only DISCOVER the missing cross module STRUCTS by normalizing against the glossary. Budget two
  passes + a hand finish: pass 1 (conform to the names you guessed) surfaces the structural holes → GROW the
  glossary (e.g. chimera tool `colors`, the vein `NodeDef`, the full `PlotManager` API) → pass 2 (conform to the
  now complete contract) converges to a handful of residuals → HAND FIX the last mile, because LLM passes
  ASYMPTOTE (4 residuals → 3 → …) and looping just burns tokens on diminishing returns. Close with a
  DETERMINISTIC grep sweep for the known anti patterns (`EnemyDefinition`, `element = nil`, `assignPlot`), a
  spec layer gate that's cheaper and surer than a third fuzzy LLM verify.

- **Tasking a small (7B) model as a JUDGE takes four specific moves** (learned wiring the qwen auditor):
  (1) **Kill the tool instinct explicitly**: an agentic coder model, handed a filename, will emit a
  `read_file` tool call instead of reasoning over the inline content; the persona must say "you have NO tools,
  the full content is pasted below, never emit JSON/a tool call." (2) **Scope to contract surface**: it will
  flag local variable/parameter/helper names as "drift"; tell it to audit ONLY exported types, glossary-
  function calls, and glossary type fields, and to IGNORE local names. (3) **Few shot with BOTH a flag and an
  ignore**: one worked example showing what to flag AND what to leave alone; bias toward flagging (advisory,
  human reviews). (4) **Deterministic post filter**: strip the model's nonsense `DRIFT X -> X` self flags in
  code, not prose. Net: tight, scoped persona + a code level safety net beats a wall of prose rules (which a 7B
  ignores). Keep the system prompt SHORT: long rule piles degrade small model adherence.

- **Spec driven builds must EMBED the spec, not NAME it; and the auditor must DISPOSE, not just advise.**
  Pointing a cecli build at "implement per specs/Elements.md" fails: gemma4 in cecli can't reliably read files
  (the tool call misfire), so it WINGS the module: it invented a FIRE/WATER/VOID stateful `Elements` instead
  of the gem schema. Embed the full `<Module>.md` + `GLOSSARY.md` text directly in the build instruction.
  Second half: the qwen auditor CORRECTLY flagged the drift (strongAgainst→strongVs, tint→color, …), but
  it was ADVISORY, so the non conformant leaf sailed through the gate (a leaf core compiles regardless of its
  internal names; only its CONSUMER or the auditor catches the drift), and the next module broke against it.
  Lesson: in spec mode the auditor's drift flags should trigger a corrective rebuild, not just a log line:
  "agents propose, gates dispose" applies to CONFORMANCE too. Also strip the playable app build clauses
  ("WIRE IT into AppService", "SURFACE IT") for pure cores: they're built in isolation and integrated later.

- **Two build modes: DETERMINISM is the default.** (1) `spec` mode (`SPRINT_SPEC_ORDER`): build a flat
  list of module files, each from its embedded `specs/<M>.md`, in order. (2) `kg` mode (`SPRINT_SPEC_FILE` +
  `SPRINT_KG`), the most deterministic, and the one PrismPath was made for:
  ONE structured spec whose `##` are REQUIREMENTS, `### Contract` the binding interface, `### Definition of
  done` the gate checkable target (pseudo code where it helps). The agent INGESTS the whole spec, instantiates
  a **knowledge graph** seeded from the spec itself (authored, not LLM derived, so the graph is deterministic),
  then builds exactly ONE node per pass: the first `pending` node whose `depends_on` are all `done`, embedding
  only that requirement's section + the GLOSSARY + the specs it names + what is already built. On a green gate
  the node flips to `done` and records its `produces`/`exports`, so later steps READ the graph instead of
  rederiving context (this is what stops a step from reinventing a module an earlier step already built). The
  KG is the source of truth for ordering, progress, and cross step memory. Per step gates run at the level the
  intermediate state can satisfy (`PLAYABILITY_GATE=0` while modules are unwired); the phase's stricter
  definition of done is a FINAL gate after the wiring step.

- **Frontier auto unblocker (Antigravity `agy`): the tiered fleet, realized.** When the local swarm is
  AUTO-STUCK (3× the same gate error), run_sprint now hands the failure to `agy` (a frontier agentic CLI) to
  fix autonomously BEFORE escalating to a human (`SPRINT_AGY=1`; sandboxed; one shot per error signature;
  human HELP fallback intact, so it's safe + opt in). This automates the "Claude unblocks the hard parts"
  role that was previously HUMAN RELAYED, the bottleneck that let the swarm spin for hours overnight.
  Three gotchas that cost real time: (1) **`agy --print` takes the PROMPT AS ITS FLAG VALUE**: `--print`
  must be ADJACENT to the task and LAST in argv, else it consumes the next token (`--add-dir`) as the prompt
  and the agent dutifully explains that flag on every run (this looked like "roaming / off task" but was a
  malformed invocation). (2) **`--model <id>` is silently ignored**: it ran the default (3.5 Flash) whether
  given the display name OR the binary's `gemini-3.1-pro` id; the dependable lever is agy's CONFIGURED default
  model, not the flag. (3) **`--sandbox` restricts the terminal, not file access**: pair it with
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for autonomous file edits with a bounded blast radius. Always smoke test a
  new CLI backend with a trivial known answer edit before trusting it unattended.

## Open framework work
- Auto refresh the umbrella/specs when they lag the tree. A `spec_check` gate (every module has a spec; every
  spec maps to a module). Make the per script spec format a template the sprint loop can consume directly as a
  feature sprint nudge. Promote this from notes → a real CLI (`prismpath spec`, `prismpath sprint <spec>`).
