# The engineer's guide

You establish the interface once, calibrate for deployment, and deliver. The process owner writes the
policy; you make it executable where it needs to run and keep it that way in CI. Most of your work
happens rarely; that is the point.

## 1. The interface, once

```bash
prismpath contract flow.md      # each node's worker output schema, derived from its `when` edges
prismpath capability flow.md    # which targets the flow compiles to, and the edges that block the rest
```

`contract` is the schema the owner's edges imply: the fields a worker must emit for each step, with
their kinds. Build the worker against it and the owner's later changes are visible as contract diffs.
`capability` reports the tiers: P0 (deterministic only), P1 (semantic edges locked to a lockfile), P2
(needs a model at run time), and whether the deterministic fragment is Level M, the part every hardware
target executes. A flow that must reach a device stays in Level M by construction.

## 2. Delivery

```bash
prismpath lock flow.md          # pin semantic routing into a lockfile for reproducible routing
prismpath compile flow.md       # the flow and its lock as a single file portable JS bundle
prismpath portable flow.md      # is this flow in the model free portable subset
prismpath plugins --check flow.md
prismpath ci-report             # the pull request report: validate, fixtures, before and after graph
```

For the compiled image, `.ppt`, the compiler is `prismpath-hw/ppt_compile.py` and the format is
`prismpath-hw/TABLE_FORMAT.md`; the C target, the kernel programs, the microcontroller firmware, and the
fabric all execute that image. The signed pack around it is your setup:

```bash
prismpath swap keygen   --out keys --name authority
prismpath swap envelope --envelope-id env1 --fields temp:int,armed:bool --caps atoms=1024,nodes=256 --priv keys/authority.priv --pub keys/authority.pub --out env
prismpath swap pack     --ppt flow.ppt --fields temp:int,armed:bool --version 3 --envelope-id env1 --priv keys/authority.priv --pub keys/authority.pub
```

The envelope declares what a host will accept (fields, capabilities, size caps); the pack binds the
image, its fields, its version, and its computed worst case bound to your key. The operator swaps and
attests; the assessor verifies. `docs/design/spec-secure-hotswap.md` is the specification.

## 3. Calibration

Thresholds are a deployment setting, so they are yours:

```bash
prismpath label       log.jsonl            # hand label routing decisions
prismpath annotate    bench.jsonl          # blind relabel for agreement measurement
prismpath kappa       a.jsonl b.jsonl      # Cohen's kappa between two label sets
prismpath calibrate   labels.jsonl         # the risk controlled escalation threshold
prismpath centroids   bench.jsonl          # prototype routing against zero shot embedding
```

`docs/decoder-ring.md` explains the statistics behind each of these in plain language.

## 4. The kernels and the gates

The Python engine is the reference for the flow language; the C target is the reference for the compiled
image's execution; the frozen corpus in `prismpath/portable/conformance/` judges every kernel. If your
change alters predicate or engine semantics, the conformance test fails by design; regenerate the
vectors, commit the diff, and say so in the pull request. `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` section 4 lists every
implementation of the interpreter, the wire, and the signed pack, which one is the reference, and what
CI gates it. `CONTRIBUTING.md` has the setup for each toolchain.

## 5. Who you hand off to

The [process owner](process-owner.md) authors and tests the policy; the [operator](operator.md) runs
the system and swaps packs you built; the [assessor](assessor.md) verifies what the receipts say.
