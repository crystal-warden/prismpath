# Documentation

Long form documentation lives here, in three groups. Start at the repo root if you're new:
[`README.md`](../README.md) is the front door and [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](../GETTING_STARTED.md)
is the walk from "what's this?" to a running flow.

> **[POSITION.md](POSITION.md)**: the public position: one sentence, the problem, the architecture in three
> words, capability status, what the comparison established, the vocabulary contract, the claims we make
> and the claims we do not. The README and the site are views over it.
>
> **[SYSTEM_MAP.md](SYSTEM_MAP.md)**: the whole system on one page: the four people who touch it,
> where every part lives, and the conformance topology that keeps the many implementations of the
> interpreter, the wire, and the signed pack in agreement.
>
> **[decoder-ring.md](decoder-ring.md)**: every borrowed term (Wilson interval, selective
> classification, match action fragment, hexagonal ports) explained in plain language, plus an
> index of every document, module, kernel, and CLI command in the repo. Start here if a paper
> loses you, or if you're looking for where something lives.

**[objections.md](objections.md)**: the two strongest critiques ("structured output already
solved routing", "logic as data is a rules engine"), answered with the concessions left in.

## guides/: how to use it

| doc | what it covers |
|---|---|
| [tour.md](guides/tour.md) | the ten minute engineer's tour of the flow kernel: worker contract, routers, prefilter, static analysis, `verify`, fan out, attestation, the portable subset |
| [authoring.md](guides/authoring.md) | the flow authoring reference: file anatomy, the four edge tiers, the worker contract, predicates, durable execution, annotations, plugins, fan out, the portable subset, and the invariants to preserve when extending |
| [workers.md](guides/workers.md) | run any program (Python, JS, Go, Rust, an existing binary) as a node's worker: the stdin/JSON/exit contract, worked examples in four languages across three jobs (CI gate, log alerting, semver release gate), error tier retry, per node engines |
| [code-nodes.md](guides/code-nodes.md) | the Python function worker case: the `@code` capability envelope, the static gate, and the fail closed sandbox |
| [frontier-agent-integration.md](guides/frontier-agent-integration.md) | pairing PrismPath with frontier agents and LLMs: CLI workers, API/local backends, auto unblock loops, `@spawn` swarms, human in the loop |
| [process-owner.md](guides/process-owner.md) | the process owner's guide: the flow and its fixtures as the policy of record, how a change reaches production |
| [engineer.md](guides/engineer.md) | the engineer's guide: the contract once, delivery, calibration, the kernels and the gates |
| [assessor.md](guides/assessor.md) | the assessor's guide: receipts, the trail, anchors, the evidence base |
| [operator.md](guides/operator.md) | the operator's day: Mission Control, swap and attest, short lived policy changes that expire by construction, reading the trail |
| [mission-control-api.md](guides/mission-control-api.md) | the Mission Control API: observe, control, events, prove |

## design/: how and why it is built

| doc | what it covers |
|---|---|
| [orchestration.md](design/orchestration.md) | the reference deployment: the sprint loop, gates as the definition of done, Mission Control, the worked example |
| [architecture.md](design/architecture.md) | the flow kernel, the portable kernels, the orchestration layer, and the gate-plugin seam |
| [framework.md](design/framework.md) | the operating methodology: spec per module, gates as the definition of done, the hard won lessons |
| [spec-guard-onion.md](design/spec-guard-onion.md) | formal design spec for the safety floor: the policy grammar with no verb for permitting |
| [spec-ledger-opentimestamps.md](design/spec-ledger-opentimestamps.md) | formal design spec for Flow Ledger anchoring: OpenTimestamps, the air gap tier, and the honest caveats |
| [spec-telemetry-cbor.md](design/spec-telemetry-cbor.md) | interop framing spec: carry the telemetry decision symbols in CBOR (RFC 8949) for friction free integration, alongside the compact Fibonacci wire |
| [spec-secure-hotswap.md](design/spec-secure-hotswap.md) | formal design spec for the secure policy hot swap: authorized, envelope bounded, attested, audited + atomic, published deliberately as prior art |
| [spec-cause-codes.md](design/spec-cause-codes.md) | the cause code registry: one byte that says why a decision or refusal happened, the same byte in the engine, the pack verifier, the kernel, the fabric, and on the wire |
| [spec-crypto-agility.md](design/spec-crypto-agility.md) | the signing suite registry and the proofs that a suite migration cannot strand a policy |

Running `python tools/arch_guard.py` writes a hexagonal boundary scorecard to
`docs/design/arch-scorecard.md`. It is generated, git ignored, and regenerated on every run: the
committed artifact is [`tools/arch_scorecard.json`](../tools/arch_scorecard.json).

## research/: papers, evidence, measurement

| doc | what it covers |
|---|---|
| [primer-students-guide.md](research/primer-students-guide.md) | **start here for the ideas**: the papers' thesis without the vocabulary; no CS degree required |
| [paper-routing-spectrum.md](research/paper-routing-spectrum.md) | the research paper: the routing spectrum, the N=301 evaluation, the head to head, limitations |
| [whitepaper-engineering.md](research/whitepaper-engineering.md) | the engineering white paper: format, runtime, data plane, control plane, operational lessons |
| [supporting-evidence.md](research/supporting-evidence.md) | the results ledger: every claim mapped to a measured result and its provenance, negative results included |
| [paper-facet-figueroa-quantization.md](research/paper-facet-figueroa-quantization.md) | the Facet paper: Figueroa quantization, the decision sufficient wire, the measurements |
| [bypass-measurement.md](research/bypass-measurement.md) | the pre registered protocol for measuring the safety floor's bypass rates, with its amendment trail |
| [LEDGER_STANDARDS.md](research/LEDGER_STANDARDS.md) | the ledger's row schema, dating, versioning, and the fold procedure |

## What isn't here (and why)

- **Normative + entry point docs stay at the repo root**: [`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) (the format
  specification), [`PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) (the Facet wire), [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) (the adopter facing script conventions), [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](../GETTING_STARTED.md), [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md),
  plus the files GitHub reads there by convention (`CONTRIBUTING`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `SECURITY`,
  `CHANGELOG`, `LICENSE`, `CITATION.cff`).
- **A `README.md` documents the directory it sits in**, so subsystem docs stay with their code:
  [portable kernel](../prismpath/portable/README.md) ·
  [conformance vectors](../prismpath/portable/conformance/README.md) ·
  [benchmark](../prismpath/benchmark/README.md) ·
  [comparisons](../prismpath/comparisons/README.md) ·
  [examples](../prismpath/examples/README.md) · [gallery](../prismpath/gallery/README.md) ·
  [editor surfaces](../prismpath/editor/README.md) ·
  [adapters](../adapters/ADAPTER_GUIDE.md) · [Go kernel](../prismpath-go/README.md).
- **Some `.md` files are program data, not documentation**: the flows in `prismpath/flows/`, the
  gallery templates, the prompt assets in `prismpath/nudges/`, the guard's
  `prismpath/policies/statutory_floor.md`, and the deliberately broken corpus in
  `prismpath/tests/fixtures/broken/`. Code reads these at runtime; they are not prose.
