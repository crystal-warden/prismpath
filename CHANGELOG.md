# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning: the **package** follows
SemVer; the **format spec** is versioned independently (SPEC.md §8); any regeneration of the
frozen conformance vectors that changes an existing case bumps the spec version, and that diff
is the spec-change review. Pre-1.0, minor versions may break APIs; the flow *format* is already
spec stable.

## [Unreleased]

### Deprecated
- **`agent` as the name for whatever does a node's work; the word is `worker`.** `run(agent=...)`
  is `run(worker=...)`, `prismpath.workers.cli_worker.cli_agent` is `cli_worker`,
  `prismpath.plugins.registry.worker_agent` is `worker_for`, and the `prismpath run --agent SPEC`
  flag is `--worker SPEC`. Every old spelling still works and still reaches the same code: the three
  Python names raise a `DeprecationWarning`, and the flag is a hidden alias on the same destination,
  so a script that passes `--agent` is undocumented rather than broken. They go away in a later
  release. The dictionary's **worker** entry lists all four as deprecated synonyms; `WorkerFn` was
  already the right name for the type.
- **The flat module names under `prismpath/`** (`prismpath.policy_pack`, `prismpath.ledger_ots`, `prismpath.analysis` and the other 64 aliases left by the September regroup into `kernel/ routing/ safety/ hotswap/ ledgers/ workers/ orchestration/ evals/`) now emit a `DeprecationWarning` on import and go away in a later release. Every first party import already uses the grouped path; adopters should import from it too.

### Changed
- **The readability refactor: the big files are split, the vocabulary is one word per thing, and no
  public name moved.** What moved: `cli.py`'s embedded 193 line JavaScript engine left for
  `prismpath/portable/bundle_engine.mjs`, where it reuses the kernel's tiers instead of disagreeing
  with them, and one `scriptedAgent` exported from `prismpath.mjs` replaced three hand kept copies;
  `prismpath/mission_control/core.py` became a facade over one module per job, with every path, port
  and cap on one `Settings` object; the connector's six ports became six mixins behind an unchanged
  `BaseConnector`, and `deferral.py`'s `__main__` self test became `prismpath/tests/test_deferral.py`;
  the fusion and compliance adapters, the fusion bench and the Vector integration became packages, so
  29 `sys.path` inserts went and the quantizer's four private helpers went public; `prismpath-rs`
  split `lib.rs` into `parser`, `engine`, `condition`, `level_m`, `reach`, `value`, `compose`,
  `connector`, `durable` and `crypto_agility`, all re exported from the crate root; the eBPF loader
  split into `ppt_image.c` (read, validate and evaluate an image on the host, no libbpf) and
  `ppt_maps.c` (fill the maps, stamp the policy hash, carry the selector's resident state across a
  swap) under a `loader.c` that is now one command table; the four XDP programs include one evaluator,
  `ppt_eval_bpf.h`, instead of four copies kept in step by hand; `rtl-tb/gate.mk` gave eleven
  ungated cocotb testbenches a real pass or fail target; and six companion walkthrough documents
  landed beside the code they explain (`prismpath-hw/EVALUATOR_WALKTHROUGH.md`,
  `PPT_FORMAT_WALKTHROUGH.md`, `esp-vision-node/FRONT_END.md`, `esp-vision-c6/RELAY_WALKTHROUGH.md`,
  `rtl-tb/README.md`, `prismpath-ebpf/EVALUATOR_WALKTHROUGH.md`). What was renamed, all of it against
  `docs/DICTIONARY.md`: the routing outcome is a `route` and the GRC outcome is a `determination`; a
  wire struct field holding an edge's declared destination is `target`; `nid` is `device_id`; a
  selector's `posture` is its `resident_node`; the receipt decoder's two senses of cause are
  `cause_code` and `refusal_cause`; the persona who reads receipts is the **assessor** and the build
  loop is **orchestration**, not "the control plane"; the per node callable is a **worker**; and the
  single letter locals across Python, the tests, telemetry, the compliance and fusion adapters, the
  hardware harnesses, the firmware C, the eBPF sources, Rust, Go and JavaScript took dictionary
  names, as did the vision firmware's one letter geometry macros (`FRAME_W`, `FRAME_H`). What a
  caller must do: nothing. Every import path, CLI verb, wire byte, frozen corpus and signed image is
  unchanged; the four renamed call surfaces keep their old spellings as deprecated aliases (see
  Deprecated above); the certified bytes (`interp.c`, the RTL,
  the eBPF programs, the cause registry) did not move, and the walkthrough documents exist because
  they cannot.
- **The README is restructured around the public position.** `docs/POSITION.md` is the canonical
  statement (one sentence, problem, prove/enforce/prove, capability status, what the comparison
  established, vocabulary contract, claims made and not made); the README, the site, and the package
  docstring are views over it. The hero says what PrismPath is, a control plane for autonomous systems,
  one of many, and the approach is what is unusual; Figueroa quantization and Facet move out of the
  hero into their own section; the comparison verdict is on the front page as the claim that did not
  survive. `prismpath.__init__` describes the grouped layout and the reading order.
- **`Graph.validate()` is gone; use `analysis.errors(graph)`.** The parser no longer imports the
  analyzer (it was the one cycle in the kernel), the Level M classifier lives in its own module
  `prismpath.level_m` (re exported from `model_check`, so `ppt_compile` and every caller keep their
  names), and the shared parse and traversal helpers moved down to `predicates.expr_ast` and
  `parser.reachable`. `prismpath.canon` holds the byte level helpers that were copied across
  modules; nothing persisted or signed changed bytes (the frozen corpora regenerate identically).
- **The Facet wire ships in the package as `prismpath.telemetry`** (moved from `adapters/telemetry`).
- **The package is grouped by concern.** `prismpath/kernel/` (parser, predicates, engine, causes,
  contract, analysis, level_m, model_check, lint, graph_export, flow_context, flow_test),
  `routing/`, `safety/`, `hotswap/`, `ledgers/`, `workers/`, `orchestration/`, `evals/`, beside
  `telemetry/`. Every old flat name (`prismpath.engine`, `prismpath.checkpoint`, ...) stays
  importable and is the same module object, so `from prismpath.checkpoint import _atomic_write`
  and monkeypatching keep working; new code should use the grouped paths. `python -m` entry points
  moved with their modules (`prismpath.safety.fuzz_predicates`, `prismpath.routing.prefilter`,
  `prismpath.orchestration.run_sprint`).
- **Crate renamed: `facet-preflight` is now `prismpath-preflight`.** The `facet-*` prefix on
  crates.io belongs to the facet reflection ecosystem; the collision was flagged by r/rust and the
  crate moved out of that namespace the same day (same code, same contract, binary renamed to
  match; `facet-preflight 0.1.0` deleted outright, inside the 72 hour window, so nothing of ours remains in that prefix). The Python twin identifies
  itself as `prismpath-preflight` too. The Facet *wire protocol* keeps its name in the papers and
  `PROTOCOL.md`, namespaced in prose as PrismPath Facet: a protocol and a crates.io prefix are
  different namespaces, and only the latter was trespassed.

### Added
- **`prismpath-preflight --privacy`: the privacy claim as a measurement, not an adjective.** Adds
  a per-field reconstruction bound (numeric fields report worst-case cell width + unbounded/
  singleton counts, booleans leak their bit, categoricals are exact on enumerated values and
  collapse the rest) and, for fusion policies, an aggregation-privacy report: how many joint input
  cells produce each verdict (a verdict made by many input cells hides which inputs made it,
  information-theoretically, even against a policy holder; one made by a single cell pins them).
  Opt-in, so the default report and the Python/Rust differential are unchanged; three new tests.
  Turns "decision-lossless, not data-lossless" into a printable number per policy.
- **Million decision soak** (`integrations/vector/soak/`, evidence #105 staged): two native codec
  Vector pipelines ran unattended for 31 and 27 hours, 1,043,442 decisions decoded, zero errors
  of any kind, flat memory, route distributions stable to a tenth of a point across inputs
  spanning nine orders of magnitude; total wire for the entire run ~1.8 MB (2.000 and 1.466
  B/event framed).
- **C2a: the wire encoder measured on bare metal** (`prismpath-hw/codec-bench/`, evidence #104
  staged). A portable C Zeckendorf encoder (78 entry table covering 2^53, 624 B constant data),
  verified byte for byte on device against reference generated wire bytes before timing, then
  measured on all four MCU instruction sets that decide policies: typical 4 field events in
  4.6 to 9.3 us on the 32 bit cores and 463 us on the 8 bit AVR floor tier (stress 1,000 cell
  codebook: 13.7 to 27.9 us and 1.76 ms). The FQ paper's §5.5 codec cost model is now a
  measurement; Merkle and the FPGA shift register half stay modeled and named.
- **`prismpath-telemetry-rs 0.1.1`: fallible twins for the spiral (Tier 6) API.** Every panicking
  spiral method now has a `try_` variant returning `Result` (`try_cell`, `try_index`,
  `try_band_id`, `try_route_of`, `try_reconstruct`, `try_reconstruct_band`,
  `try_encode_decision`, `try_encode_progressive`), std indexing style: the panicking form is the
  documented convenience, the fallible form is the total function. Purely additive, behavior of
  the existing API unchanged (two new tests pin `try_` == panicking on every frozen corpus probe,
  and Err instead of panic on missing fields and out of range indices). One internal cleanup:
  the quantizer's remaining guarded `unwrap` became `is_none_or`. The codec path was already
  panic free; this closes the gap on the optional tier.
- **prismpath-preflight, the adoption gate for the Facet codec** (`adapters/telemetry/preflight.py`).
  One command takes a policy flow plus a sample of real events (NDJSON) and reports the derived
  codebook, exactly which events encode and why the rest do not (missing fields, unmapped nested
  paths via `--map`, out of partition values, float truncation), projected bytes per event next to
  the raw JSON, and the route distribution at every branch point. Every encodable event is replayed
  through the full round trip (quantize, Fibonacci-code, decode, reconstruct) and checked to route
  identically to the original at every decision node, so decision preservation is verified on the
  integrator's own data. Flags mirror the Vector codec exactly (`--map` = `field_paths`,
  `--on-missing` = `on_missing`, one byte aligned reading per frame); exit 0 only when nothing needs
  attention, so it drops into CI. Seven-case test suite; the stale Vector run commands in
  `integrations/README.md` were corrected to the native two instance pipeline at the same time.
- **prismpath-preflight in Rust** (`prismpath-preflight/`, new workspace member; binary
  `prismpath-preflight`). The same contract as the Python tool (flags, report sections, JSON schema,
  exit codes) running on the exact crates the Vector codec is built from, so its report is what
  the codec will do by construction and it speaks the upstream audience's language
  (`cargo run -p prismpath-preflight`). The two are deliberate twins: Python = the independent
  reference oracle, Rust = the codec's own path; running both on one sample is a differential
  test of the stack, and on the clean corpus their JSON reports are identical. The port also
  surfaced a real value-model divergence the Python tool cannot see: the crates coerce a
  non-numeric string on a numeric field to 0 (the reference errors instead), so the Rust tool
  reports COERCED TO 0 per field and withholds READY. Seven integration tests against the
  compiled binary, including the coercion case; clippy clean. Published to crates.io as
  `facet-preflight 0.1.0` on the owner's go; the registry-installed binary verified end to end
  (`cargo install facet-preflight`, the name at publish time; since renamed, and the old crate
  deleted, see Changed above).
- **facet-init, the migration drafter** (`adapters/telemetry/facet_init.py`). Reads the
  `vector.toml` an integrator already runs, transcribes every route and filter condition that is
  Level M expressible (`field OP const` under and/or/not, `includes([..], .field)` as `in`) into a
  DRAFT flow with the transforms chained as nodes, maps nested event paths to codec `field_paths`
  suggestions, and verifies the draft end to end through the preflight tool on the sample. Conditions
  that do not transcribe (function calls, regex, VRL variables, field vs field, null, float
  thresholds) are reported verbatim with the reason. No condition is ever learned from the sample:
  the tool drafts and the author signs, preserving the derived-from-authored-policy property the
  quantization paper's §3.4 rests on. Skeleton mode (no `vector.toml`) annotates discovered fields
  and writes zero conditions. Six-case test suite covering transcription, refusal reasons, chain
  stitching, and the end to end preflight-ready loop.
- **Canary recipe for cutting over to Facet** (`integrations/vector/CANARY.md` +
  `canary_verify.py`). Run Facet beside the pipeline you trust: one source fans out to the
  existing sink unchanged and to a Facet sink, an aggregator decodes the wire, and the verifier
  replays every raw event through the reference implementation to prove the decoded leg routes
  identically (counts, every position, per route distributions; encoder dropped events keep
  positions synchronized). Exit 0 only on parity, so the check drops into CI during the soak.
  Live proven with the fork build: 400 events across seven routes, exact parity; a single
  tampered threshold crossing is named by position and fails the run. The doc covers policy
  pinning via `policy_sha256`, `field_paths`, cutover and rollback (the raw leg is the
  parachute), and honest scope (representatives not magnitudes, ordering assumptions, the 2^53
  bound). Five-case test suite.

### Removed
- **Pruned two unvalidatable adapters and the redundant native crate; genericized fusion.** The
  `adapters/soc/` and `adapters/compliance/` adapters and the `prismpath-fusion-rs` crate were archived
  out of the shipped repo (preserved on device), along with the fusion adapter's `live_capture.py` live
  capture harness and the `cw-triage` systemd poller units. The fusion adapter is reframed as **the
  decision fusion plane**: it joins any N decision sources into one Level M decidable, provable fused
  decision carried on the Facet wire, with the cyber plus IMU pairing kept as its v1 worked example and
  the SIEM source demoted to one example connector (archived). The reference adapters are now telemetry
  and fusion; CI drops the soc and compliance test steps and the fusion suite stays green. The removed
  adapters' historical evidence rows are retained and annotated, not rewritten.

### Changed
- **The eBPF live hot swap is now double buffered and proven atomic under concurrency** (evidence
  #93), closing the "still element-wise (not double-buffered)" caveat from #88. The `ppt_net`
  program's four table maps are doubled into two banks; a packet reads a single `__u32` bank
  selector (`bank_map`) once (an aligned load, atomic against the loader's aligned store) and
  evaluates entirely within that bank. `netupdate` writes the inactive bank in full, then commits
  with ONE update to `bank_map`; a failed inactive-bank write is never committed, so the active
  policy is untouched on any error. New `loader netstorm <a> <b>` proof: a thread flips banks
  0↔1 while another hammers `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN`; **200,000 evaluations under ~500k concurrent
  flips, TORN=0** on both aarch64 and x86_64, verdicts split ~50/50 between banks (the race was
  real). The conformance program `ppt_xdp` is single bank and untouched; **124/124 unchanged on
  both architectures**.

### Added
- **Crypto-agility control plane; govern *which* crypto suite is authorized to be live, provably**
  (`prismpath/crypto_registry.py`, `crypto_agility.py`, `crypto_host.py`; spec
  `docs/design/spec-crypto-agility.md`; evidence #94). A crypto-suite-selection policy is a Level M
  match action flow whose terminal nodes are the suites, so five machine checked proofs turn
  governed crypto-agility from a claim into a property: **P1** no reachable state selects an
  unapproved suite, **P2** every context routes to a defined suite (no silent default cipher),
  **P3** a data class never routes below its floor suite, **P4** once past a migration phase no
  classical-only suite is reachable (algorithm-level anti-rollback, proven *statically*; the
  matrix `crypto_migration.json` confirms P4 holds ⇔ floor ≥ gate in all 12 cells), **P5** the
  policy is decidable. The runtime `CryptoHost` accepts a swap only when Authorized (signed pack) +
  Envelope-bounded (declared suites ⊆ approved AND the pack's `registry_hash` matches the live
  signed registry, so a swap can't re-point a suite id at a weaker primitive) + monotonic (version
  floor) + provider-available, and **provider absence refuses rather than downgrades**: on a host
  whose vetted `cryptography` lacks ML-KEM, the CNSA-2 policy swap is refused and the live classical
  policy stays put, never silently weakened. Every attempt is one Merkle-logged audit event. 26
  tests; four deliberate-fail conformance cases keep the proofs falsifiable. **Control plane, not
  cipher:** PrismPath governs selection/proof/attestation and delegates every operation to a vetted
  provider; ML-KEM/ML-DSA registry rows are inert-until-a-provider-ships-them, disclosed as prior
  art now. Rust mirror + JS twin of the proofs, and the image-native eBPF/FPGA/MCU tiers, are named
  follow-ons.
- **OTLP baseline for the decision wire** (`adapters/fusion/bench/otlp_baseline.py`; evidence #95),
  closing the named follow-on in #84. Encodes the same fused decision as a genuine, round-tripping
  `opentelemetry.proto` LogRecord (OpenTelemetry; the wire observability pipelines actually speak)
  and measures it against the decision stream: OTLP-faithful is **101.4 B/decision** vs the decision
  wire's **1.5** → **67.6×**, and **4.8×** even against zstd batched OTLP. Honest finding baked in:
  OTLP is **1.49× larger than minimal JSON** for this payload (per record timestamps + typed
  attributes + repeated keys), so the win over it is structural; self framing streamability,
  tamper evidence, decidability; not a compression trick. Test `importorskip`s `opentelemetry`, so
  the bare adapters CI job skips it cleanly.
- **Crypto-agility proofs ported to the Rust and JS kernels** (`prismpath-rs/src/crypto_agility.rs`,
  proofs in `prismpath/portable/prismpath.mjs`; evidence #96), closing the cross language follow-on
  named in #94. Both replay the two frozen fixtures (`crypto_agility.json` + `crypto_migration.json`)
  byte for byte against the Python reference: Rust `test_crypto_agility` gates in `cargo test`
  (`durable` is default), and the JS twin (`node run_crypto_agility.mjs`) is a CI port-job step. So
  provable crypto-agility is now conformance-gated across Python, Rust, and JS.
- **RP2350 cross ISA substrate** (`prismpath-hw/rp2350/`; evidence #97, staged). The byte exact
  interpreter (`ppt_rp2350.c`, a USB-CDC port of the AVR's `ppt_uno.c`) decides the frozen corpus
  **124/124 on BOTH cores of the RP2350 from one source**: the ARM Cortex-M33 and the Hazard3
  RISC-V; with byte identical exclusion reasons. One `.ppt`, two ISAs of one die, same decision:
  cross ISA conformance, not just cross language. Built from a single Pico SDK CMake project
  (`make arm` / `make riscv`); the ISA tag is chosen by the compiler.
- **ESP32 Xtensa substrate** (`prismpath-hw/esp/`; evidence #98, staged). The same byte exact
  interpreter certifies **124/124 on an ESP32 (ESP-WROOM-32, Xtensa LX6)** over its UART, adding
  **Xtensa** as a third MCU ISA; so 8-bit AVR, ARM, RISC-V, and Xtensa now all decide the signed
  policy identically. One ISA-generic ESP-IDF project (ident + UART pins chosen at compile time from
  `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`) targets esp32 or esp32c6.
- **On-device sensor → decision demo** (`prismpath-hw/rp2350/ppt_tof.c` + `vl53l0x.c`; evidence #99,
  staged). The RP2350 reads a real **VL53L0X** time-of-flight sensor over I2C, forms the field vector
  itself, and runs a signed Level M proximity policy **on device**: distance routes to
  contact/near/mid/far live, no host in the loop, the decision flipping exactly at the authored
  100/300/800 mm thresholds. The first physical-input demonstrator since the FPGA fabric; the policy
  `.ppt` is baked into flash from the same compiler every substrate uses.
- **Coordinated fleet policy swap over ESP-NOW** (`prismpath-hw/mesh/`; evidence #100, staged). Three
  ESP32 nodes swap policy **together**: one table is broadcast, **re verified on every node before it
  is staged** (each follower re-hashes it and checks the id against a baked allowlist; a mismatch is
  refused, not swapped), committed only after a quorum ACKs, and applied at a shared tick so the fleet
  flips within **0.7 ms** (host-observed, serial jitter included). The multi node analogue of the
  single-node hot swap (#87/#88); same verify-then-swap / refuse-don't-downgrade contract, extended
  across a mesh with a two phase commit so no node flips alone. FNV-1a id/allowlist stands in for the
  signature (Ed25519-on-the-mesh is the named follow-on).
- **Context ledger; attest what a frozen model was conditioned on** (`prismpath/context_ledger.py`,
  mirrored in `prismpath-rs::durable::ContextLedger`; evidence #91). For a hardwired/frozen-weights
  model the context is the only mutable state, so it is the governance surface: an append only
  ledger commits each context segment by content hash (salted via `salt_leaf` for low entropy
  text), chains them (order-binding), Merkle-roots them (per segment inclusion proofs), and binds
  the root into the standard provenance manifest (context root = manifest root, segment leaves =
  ingestion hashes, chain head in the label, model identity = knowledge hash). Hashes only;
  content never enters the artifact. Cross-language byte parity gated by a new frozen corpus
  (`portable/conformance/context.json`); the in-lab demonstrator's per-token receipts now carry
  `context_root`, tying every verdict to exactly the user text and rendered template it was made
  over.

### Fixed
- **Level M classifier soundness: float constants are no longer mis-classified as table-compilable.**
  `field OP <float>` (e.g. `when score >= 0.9`) was reported as Level M, but the match action fragment's
  value domain is `i32` (there is no float on the table, in silicon, or in the kernel) so the condition
  is genuinely outside the fragment. `is_level_m` / `capability_report` (Python and the JS kernel
  `prismpath.mjs`) now reject it (`disallowed-or-unparseable`), and SPEC §4.3 says "**integer**, boolean,
  or string literal" where it previously said the imprecise "numeric". This removes **11 float over-claims**
  from the classifier's Level M count over the frozen corpus; the FPGA/eBPF runnable subset (114) is
  unchanged; the compiler already rejected floats, so no certified number moves. Corpora gain a
  `float_const` case. (Python↔JS agree bit for bit on floats incl. `1e3`, `.5`, `2.0e1`, floats-in-lists.)

### Changed
- **Negative (and unary-plus) integer literals are now inside the predicate language and the Level M
  fragment.** `when x >= -1282` was rejected everywhere; the sandbox flagged the `USub` node as
  disallowed syntax, and the classifier/compiler never saw a constant; even though the `.ppt`
  format already stores `val` as a signed `i32` and both `interp.c` and the RTL compare signed. The
  gap was purely front end. A single normalization, `predicates.fold_unary_signs`, folds
  `UnaryOp(USub|UAdd, Constant(int))` into a signed `Constant` right after parse, applied at the one
  place check / eval / the Level M classifier / the PPT compiler all share, so they accept the same
  language (SPEC §4.4). Scope is deliberately narrow and the sandbox stays exactly as tight: only
  **integer** operands fold, so `-<float>` (e.g. `-0.0`) keeps its pre existing rejection and
  `-field` (arithmetic on a name, e.g. `-x`) stays outside the language; the bare `USub` node never
  reaches the allowlist walk. Mirrored bit for bit in the JS (`prismpath.mjs`) and Rust
  (`prismpath-rs`) kernels; **all three conformance runners CONFORMANT** on the regenerated corpus.
  **Measured effect:** the frozen predicate corpus goes **v1 → v2** (1067 → 1079 cases; one existing
  vector `when -1 < x` flips from `ERROR` to `True`; the bug being fixed); Level M cases 126 → 136,
  distinct Level M conditions 119 → 126; the **C-target declared subset re certifies 114 → 124/1079,
  zero divergence**, and a negative-literal table (`x >= -1282`) was **proven on the Zynq-7020
  fabric** deciding correctly at the exact boundary (−1283 → low, −1282 → high). Nothing on the board
  changed; the circuit already compares signed `i32`. SPEC §4.3 updated. Pins moved (fragment count,
  corpus version). **eBPF re certified same day: 124/124 in kernel on BOTH aarch64 and x86_64 with
  the hardened loader** (`BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN`, table-per-vector), and the held `loader.c` hardening
  smokes passed on a live attach (drop_mask survives `netupdate`; an over-`MAX_*` image is rejected
  with the running table untouched); the cross substrate headline reconciles at **124** (evidence
  #90). The **RTL re-sweep** to 124/1079 remains pending a hardware retest.
- **Chained comparisons are normalized into the Level M fragment, not excluded; one shared desugaring.**
  SPEC §4.3 said chained comparisons (`when 1 < x < 5`) "SHOULD be desugared by tooling" but the
  classifier (`verify --level-m` / `capability_report`) reported them as *outside* the fragment while the
  PPT compiler desugared and accepted them; a real gap between "is this hardware-compilable?" and what the
  compiler actually did. Now both **desugar-then-classify** through a single `model_check._desugar_chains`
  (the compiler imports it; the JS kernel mirrors it): `a < b < c` → `a < b and b < c`, exact under
  §4.1 to §4.2 (pure operands, total comparisons). A chained comparison is Level M iff each conjunct is;
  `1 < x < 5` is in fragment, `1 < a < b` is not (`a < b` is field-vs-field, now reported with that precise
  reason instead of a blanket "chained"). Net effect over the corpus: classifier **= compiler = 126 cases /
  119 distinct, 0 disagreements** (pinned by `test_classifier_compiler_gap_pinned`); the 114 runnable
  subset is unchanged (the compiler already desugared, so no certified number moves). SPEC §4.3 updated
  (chained moved from "Excluded" to a normalization rule); conformance corpora `level_m.json` /
  `capability.json` flip the `chained` case to Level M → **spec-vector version 1 → 2**.

### Added
- **Secure policy hot swap: a live policy replacement that is authorized, envelope bounded, attested,
  and audited; published in full as prior art.** A `.ppt` policy now ships as a *pack*: the
  byte identical image plus a detached Ed25519 signed manifest (`prismpath/policy_pack.py`), so the
  image hash the FPGA/eBPF evidence rows cite never changes. `PolicyHost`
  (`prismpath/policy_host.py`) runs the swap pipeline; signature → envelope-conformance
  (counts ≤ caps, fields ⊆ envelope, an image-native opcode-whitelist walk re verifying Level M
  membership at load time) → monotonic-version anti-rollback → shadow-stage → single atomic reference
  flip; and writes every attempt, accepted or **rejected**, to the Merkle rooted `audit_log`
  (OTS-anchorable), so "policy X was live from T1 to T2" is provable. Any failure at any stage leaves
  the prior policy active (fail safe), and `rollback()` restores last-known-good. Crypto is the
  optional `signing` extra with **loud absence** (verification unavailable → refuse with the install
  message, never a silent pass); a demo `--allow-unsigned` path stamps `unsigned: true` into the
  ledger rather than hide it. CLI: `prismpath swap {keygen,pack,verify,envelope,swap,attest}`. The
  mechanism is specified and disclosed as prior art in
  [`docs/design/spec-secure-hotswap.md`](docs/design/spec-secure-hotswap.md) (no patent sought). This
  is the software reference tier; FPGA/MCU are named follow-ons under the hardware-retest rule.
- **eBPF trusted pre loader for the hot swap (`prismpath-ebpf/net_swap.py`).** Puts the authorization
  and envelope gates in front of the kernel `netupdate`: it verifies the signed pack against its
  signed envelope and the version floor on the host, and execs the loader **only** on success; a
  verification failure never reaches the kernel. Privilege-free up to the loader exec, so the whole
  gate is tested without root (the loader call is injected; 5 tests, including "tampered/replayed
  images never reach the loader").
- **Cyber-physical fusion proven on the live rig: real IMU + real SIEM fused in real time, with the
  sensor's own on chip fusion classifier as an independent cross-check.**
  `adapters/fusion/live_capture.py` runs the BNO086 (via `prismpath-hw/bridge/field_bridge_multi.py`,
  decision fields byte identical to the committed pipeline + on chip quaternion/orientation and the
  chip's own stability classifier at 10 Hz) and the live SIEM in the same window, joining each alert
  to the coincident device posture and routing it through `fusion_triage`. Across 3 live sessions
  (**4,369 real readings + 90 real SIEM alerts**, incl. a self-triggered level-10 auth-failure event
  as authorized detection-validation), the chip's AI classifier agreed with our derived posture
  **96.3%** of the time, and the multi-modal-to-decision bandwidth was **~252 B vs ~6 bits per
  reading (333×), live**. Honest scope: `tandem_watch`/`coincident_critical` stayed empty across all
  sessions (no high severity cyber event coincided with the right posture; the rare signal, honestly
  unlit); the full six-channel suite saturates the MCP2221A HID pipe (10 Hz trio is the sustainable
  rate; the case for wiring the sensor directly to the FPGA). Evidence row #85; aggregate artifacts
  are aggregate-only (privacy-tested).
- **Cyber-physical decision fusion adapter (`adapters/fusion/`): one Level M flow joins IMU posture
  and SIEM verdicts; proved, tessellated, censused, and bandwidth-measured on real data.**
  `flows/fusion_triage.md` fuses `{stability, dev_mg}` (the sensor bridge's own fields; thresholds
  150/500/2500 are its DEADBAND/MOVE_DEV/SHAKE_DEV constants) with `{rule_level, soc_action}` (7/12
  are the SIEM's triage floor and the wazuh_triage containment edge) into 7 verdicts;
  escalation default, coincidence checked first, `else` last. `flow_level_m` → `(True, [])`
  asserted in suite; the 108-cell / 7-band Tier-6 tessellation is frozen
  (`conformance/spiral_fusion.json`, flow sha256 pinned, 34 boundary probes decisions-preserved
  three ways; the first mixed numeric/categorical spiral corpus, no telemetry change needed).
  `census.py` weights the bands with the real month scale backlog (64,483 triage alerts of
  2,498,693 total) + 10,421 real IMU session rows; pairings labeled (`assume_still`,
  `independence_expected`; NOT time coincident; the empty coincident bands are the finding), and
  the committed artifact is aggregates-only (privacy regression test enforced).
  `bench/bandwidth.py` measures the full population, overheads itemized and included:
  **O1 1.516 B/alert vs raw 3,020 B/alert (1,992×; 45× vs minimal 4-field JSON); the band-ID
  stream is 0.516 B/alert (~4.1 bits/decision)**: gate PASS, with the buffered-batch-compressor
  caveat stated in the results before anyone else can state it. Honest scope: software proof only
  (substrate cert + hardware retest is a named follow-on), the census projection is decidable (not
  an adjudicator verdict), and the live coincident capture is the only future true-joint artifact.
  Evidence rows #82 to #84.
- **eBPF target: real packet classification on live traffic + measured latency + live policy hot swap.**
  `ppt_net.bpf.c` reuses the verified eval back end with a real packet front end (parses on wire
  Ethernet/IPv4/TCP-UDP into a fixed canonical register file) and classifies each packet with a Level M
  table, observe only. Attached to `span0` (the home-traffic mirror) it classified thousands of real
  packets in kernel with a sensible TLS-dominant distribution. Per-packet latency measured via
  `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN`: **132 to 182 ns/packet, ~5.5 to 7.6 Mpps/core**: sub microsecond, earned not asserted.
  `netupdate` **hot swaps the policy of a running program in place** (repopulates the table maps via the
  program's map-IDs; no detach, no reload); demonstrated live by editing `net_triage.md`, recompiling,
  and swapping a 7-class table for an 8-class one while classification continued uninterrupted. New:
  `ppt_net.bpf.c`, `net_triage.md`, `net_compile.py`, loader `netattach`/`netstats`/`netdetach`/
  `netbench`/`netupdate`. Honestly bounded (README §9): observe only (no inline drop yet), generic/SKB
  XDP, latency is program compute cost not end to end wire latency.
- **eBPF target: in kernel conformance + whole-flow execution.** The `prismpath-ebpf` loader gained
  `certify` / `run` / `runbatch` modes that drive the actual verifier accepted XDP program in kernel via
  `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN`. The eBPF target now **certifies 114/114 of the declared subset** (the same
  114/1067 filter `prismpath-hw`'s C-target uses; in fragment condition + read fields i32-representable)
  of the frozen `predicates.json` corpus in kernel, byte matching `interp.c`; the other 953 vectors are
  excluded and itemized, none an eBPF limit. Real
  multi node flows execute in kernel: the 12-node `adapters/soc/flows/wazuh_triage.md` routed a **live
  Wazuh alert stream** (real LLM verdicts) 27/27 identically to the reference. New harness:
  `cert_corpus.py`, `cert_vectors.py`, `run_flow_demo.py`, `run_stream_demo.py`, `run_incident_demo.py`.
  Framing: the Level M corpus is the cross substrate standard; richer tiers are named, never a lump "+X."
  Not yet done (stated honestly in the target README): live line-rate deployment, a real packet parser
  front end, and measured performance.
- **`prismpath context <flow.md>`** (`prismpath/flow_context.py`); emits the kernel's own *verified*
  facts about a flow (nodes, edges, declared fields, reachability, Level M status, capability tiers) as
  grounding for an agent authoring/editing it. Composes `model_check` primitives; JSON or prose.

### Changed
- **Sprint-engine hygiene: it never deletes your files, and the game-flavored "council" is gone.**
  `run_sprint.py` no longer auto-wipes `SPRINT_PROJ`; the old `SPRINT_FRESH=1` default ran
  `shutil.rmtree`, one typo from erasing a real project. Greenfield now requires an empty dir (or
  `SPRINT_EXTEND=1` to build on an existing tree), else it errors clearly; choosing and clearing the
  location is the user's call. The **council** deliberation subsystem (`prismpath/plugins/council/`,
  the `prismpath/dice.py` shim, `council_next`, the role lenses) is **deleted**: the swarm backend
  uses the `review` role. Game-flavored language ("player", "gameplay", "one more run", "world object",
  …) is removed from the core: PrismPath itself carries no game flavor; that lives only in
  ports/adapters/examples.

### Added
- **eBPF/XDP target; a decidable PrismPath table runs in the Linux kernel** (`prismpath-ebpf/`). A
  third certified substrate beside the Python reference and the FPGA C-table (`prismpath-hw/`): a
  Level M / PPT table image is loaded into BPF maps and executed by an XDP program whose interpreter
  (nested `bpf_loop` for the edge + prog machines, a constant-indexed operand stack, a per-CPU-map
  register file) is **accepted by the kernel verifier** and computes verdicts **byte identical to the
  C reference `interp.c`** on real packets; proven end to end (`sudo make smoke`) at full 32/64/64
  bounds on kernel 6.17. Declared subset: operand-stack depth ≤ 4. The PPT format + reference
  interpreter stay canonical in `prismpath-hw` (referenced, not duplicated). `prismpath-ebpf/README.md`
  has the full verifier analysis, including the approaches that failed and why.
- **Portability matrix + reachability, now in the portable kernel and provably in sync**: two
  analyses that used to be Python-only are ported to `prismpath/portable/prismpath.mjs`:
  `capabilityReport` (which targets a flow compiles to; python / portable JS-Rust-Go / Level M
  hardware; and, for the ones it doesn't, the blocking edges) and `checkReach` (three-valued
  yes/may/no bounded-model-checking reachability with `assume`/visit-caps/witnesses). Each is a faithful
  port of its `model_check` reference and is **certified against a frozen corpus** so the CLI and the
  browser can never disagree: `capability.json` (6 cases) and `reach.json` (11 cases), checked from
  Python (`test_capability_conformance.py`, `test_reach_conformance.py`) and JS
  (`run_capability.mjs`, `run_reach.mjs`). New CLI subcommand `prismpath capability <flow>` prints the
  matrix (`--json` for machine output). The website playground gains a live **Targets** matrix and a
  **Prove reachability** panel (node picker + optional `assume`, verdict + witness path), all
  client-side.
- **Code nodes; governed workers with a capability-scoped sandbox** (`prismpath/code_nodes.py`,
  `prismpath/sandbox.py`). A node's worker can be plain code; the flow still governs the routing
  (branching stays on the edges). Each code node declares an `@code(net, fs, timeout_s, mem_mb)`
  capability envelope; statically checkable (`check_code_nodes`, verifiable like Level M); and runs
  **fail-closed**: no undeclared code, no invalid envelope, and (via `SandboxRunner`) a `bwrap`
  subprocess whose profile is derived from the envelope, **refusing rather than degrading** when the
  sandbox is unavailable. Guide: [`docs/guides/code-nodes.md`](docs/guides/code-nodes.md); 14 tests.
- **Security posture clarified** ([`docs/design/spec-guard-onion.md`](docs/design/spec-guard-onion.md)
  §1.5): PrismPath owns provable **routing** and governed code **execution** (the code-node sandbox);
  **content** safety is delegated to the model or an opt-in guard; the routing layer is the wrong place
  for a content filter. The content guard is therefore an **optional**
  floor (`guard.py`, Journeyman's `guard.ts`), deliberately **not** embedded in the portable Rust/Go/JS
  kernels; each kernel's `CONFORMANCE.md` now states "a conformant kernel is not a content-guarded one."
- **Mission Control rebuilt as a proving + observability command center**
  (`prismpath/mission_control/`, now a FastAPI package; run `python -m prismpath.mission_control`).
  A single-user, loopback console over a **versioned JSON API** (`/api/v1`, OpenAPI at `/docs`): the
  flow topology (vendored Cytoscape) with live run-state over SSE; **text-in proving**: `POST
  /prove/level-m` and `POST /prove/reach` run the real `model_check` against a posted flow document,
  never a server path (closing the old arbitrary-read surface); audit self-verify; RAG-retrieval
  visibility (`/retrievals`, per node); a **buffered/unbuffered** launch toggle. The proving/
  observability API is the driving adapter other services connect to; the browser console is its
  first client. It runs **no models**: inference belongs to the worker tier. Needs the
  `control-plane` extra (fastapi/uvicorn/pydantic). Guide:
  [`docs/guides/mission-control-api.md`](docs/guides/mission-control-api.md); 13-test TestClient suite.
  **Removed** with the old multi-user scope: Tailscale identity, the Gemma chat, RAG doc-upload, and
  the AGY tab; the stdlib `http.server` console (`python -u prismpath/mission_control.py`) is retired.
- **The sprint engine goes language-agnostic**: a **pysprint gate** plugin
  (`prismpath/plugins/pysprint/`) runs pytest as the definition-of-done, so a sprint can build Python
  targets, not just web; plus a **feature-extend mode** (`SPRINT_EXTEND`; skip greenfield ideate to
  extend an existing tree) and an **uncheatable frozen gate** (tests read from a read only dir outside
  the sandbox). `run_sprint.py` now honors the gate plugin's `FILE_EXTS`.
- **mdflow interop** (`prismpath/examples/mdflow_interop/`): mdflow tasks run as PrismPath workers
  behind the routing kernel ("PrismPath governs the routing; mdflow provides the action"), via mdflow's
  `--json` envelope; gated example + tests.
- **The Level M hardware target ([`prismpath-hw/`](prismpath-hw/README.md))**;
  a Level M flow compiles to a binary table image (`wazuh_triage`, unmodified: 302 bytes)
  interpreted by one fixed FPGA circuit on a Zynq-7020; C and RTL interpreters certified on a
  **declared subset** of the frozen corpus (114/1,067 predicate + 6/27 engine vectors, zero
  divergence, machine readable exclusion reasons; deliberately *not* SPEC §8 conformance);
  timing clean at 50 MHz (1,064 LUTs = 2.0% of the part, WCET 100 to 420 ns/decision); 2,985 live
  sensor samples routed in fabric; evidence hashes OTS-anchored. Gates: `make cert` + the cocotb
  suites under `prismpath-hw/`; evidence ledger rows #72 to #76. Built off to the side, landed as
  a top-level target directory beside `prismpath-rs/` and `prismpath-go/` after clearing the
  repo's gates (the CLI integration, `compile --target c-table`, stays open on the roadmap).
- **Four conformant kernels**: `prismpath-go` joins Python / JS (`prismpath/portable/prismpath.mjs`) /
  Rust (`prismpath-rs`): a dependency free Go P0 kernel at 1,067/1,067 predicates and 27/27 flows
  against the frozen vectors. Conformance is now a refereed sport with three independent referees.
- **`prismpath verify`: formal model checking** (`prismpath/model_check.py`): "state X can never be
  reached under condition Y", answered by adversarial-worker reachability with first-match
  semantics. Exact verdicts with concrete witness outcomes over the **Level M match action
  fragment** (SPEC §4.3 membership is now reported per edge, and `portability_tier` carries a
  `level_m` flag); sound over-approximation outside it (semantic/error/event hops labeled "may");
  `visits` modeled with saturation so UNREACHABLE is proven for all bounds. `--reach/--forbid/
  --assume/--bound/--level-m/--json`.
- **`prismpath lsp`: a Language Server, stdlib only** (`prismpath/lsp.py`): live diagnostics (the
  full validate check set, anchored to the offending edge line), completion (targets, derived
  predicate fields, tier keywords, annotations), hover, document symbols, and a `prismpath/graph`
  Mermaid request; for Neovim, JetBrains (LSP4IJ), VS Code, and any LSP editor. Client setup in
  `prismpath/editor/README.md`.
- **Fan out debugging + live visualization**: `composer.fanout_tree()` (read only composition
  trees: all child stop states, join progress with the gate-aware done-criterion, `child_error`
  reasons, nested fan-outs) behind Mission Control's new **Flows tab** (`/api/fanouts`,
  `/api/fanout/ckpt` queue-dir-confined).
- **The Connector SDK, complete** (`prismpath/connector.py`): all six hexagonal ports;
  Adjudicator (callable-driven, never assumes an LLM; flat prompts via `PayloadFlattener`;
  optional `guard.guarded_exchange` routing), Deferral (`DeferralStore` wiring), an idempotent
  JSONL sink default, `checkpoint.flow_hash()` (public) as the attestation policy hash, and the
  proven one-line plugin pattern `WORKERS = MyConnector().get_workers()`.
- **Production SIEM integrations** (`adapters/soc/siem.py`): a `SIEMSource` ingestion port with
  `ElasticSource` (any Elasticsearch/OpenSearch-compatible indexer; env-configured, TLS
  verification on by default), `WazuhSource` (lazy, opt-in legacy credentials), `NDJSONFileSource`
  (air-gap/replay), and a best-effort `SplunkSource`. The SOC agent now rides the Connector SDK
  (`WazuhTriageConnector`) with env seams matching the compliance adapter, plus `cw-triage`
  systemd units.
- **Automatic prefilter tuning**: `prefilter.tune()` derives the cache's operating point from
  evidence: a (threshold × min_conf) sweep with a **Wilson upper bound** certifying the
  reuse-error rate ≤ `--risk` (the `calibrate` pattern applied to reuse); refuses to choose when
  the evidence can't clear the bound. `tuning.json` slots under explicit args and env in
  precedence; the SOC adapter's `labels` command feeds the tuner its own adjudication history.

- **`prismpath ci-report` + the PR comment**: the money demo as a living product: for every flow a
  PR changes, one sticky comment with validate findings, fixture verdicts, and the routing topology
  **before → after as live Mermaid diagrams** (GitHub renders them in the conversation). The Action
  gained a `comment` input (needs `pull-requests: write`); the command works locally too
  (`prismpath ci-report --base origin/main`). Gate semantics: errors and failing fixture rows exit 1;
  advisories inform. Fixture tables needing the embedding tier report "skipped" on kernel-only
  runners instead of failing. Flow detection requires front-matter, so prose docs that embed flow
  snippets are never misreported.
- **URL-shareable playground flows**: 🔗 Share encodes the whole flow (+ scripted outcomes) into
  the URL fragment (base64url; nothing leaves the page; there is no server). Every flow is now a
  link: click it, watch it route, edit the rules live. Cold-load and hashchange both verified in a
  real browser, unicode round-trips.
- **`prismpath run --agent ollama:MODEL`** (and `openai:MODEL@BASE` for vLLM / LM Studio /
  llama.cpp); a real local model as the worker, one flag after clone (`chat_agent.py`, stdlib
  only). JSON replies feed `when` predicates; endpoint failures ride the flow's `on error` edges.
  Verified live against a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint and pinned by 7 stub-server tests.
- **Three more gallery templates**: `pr_review` (approval with a human gate + the visits-cap
  idiom), `fanout_review` (parent + `review_one` child; `prismpath init --template` now copies a
  template's whole working set, so `@spawn` children travel), `support_triage` (semantic
  classification + deterministic money/severity guard rails). All validate clean; all fixture
  tables green with no model installed.
- **The editor surface** (`prismpath/editor/vscode/`): a VS Code extension, all thin wrappers over the
  repo's own tooling: a TextMate *injection* grammar coloring edge lines by tier (deterministic /
  semantic / error / event / always) + `@annotations` inside plain Markdown; a live preview webview
  hosting the SAME `prismpath/portable/playground.html` + JS kernel as the browser playground (seeded from the
  buffer, re-fed on every edit; tier badges, checks, ▶ Run, Mermaid; **no Python needed**); and
  optional validate-on-save diagnostics mapped to `## node` lines. The playground gained a
  postMessage embedding hook any host page can use. Grammar tier-classification is pinned by tests.
- **`prismpath init --template <name>`**: every gallery entry doubles as a starter (`--template list`);
  copies the flow AND its routing tests, and the model free `validate → test` loop works immediately.
- **`prismpath plugins --new <name>`**: scaffold a pip-installable **worker pack** (pyproject with the
  `prismpath.plugins` entry point, `WORKERS` module with a pure example + the `CliWorker` bridge
  comment, pytest, README). Verified end to end: `pip install -e` → appears in `prismpath plugins` as
  `[entry-point]` → `@worker(<name>.<worker>)` resolves.
- **The plugin ecosystem** (`prismpath/plugins/registry.py`): harness-side extension with the engine's
  purity untouched. Plugins (bundled, or pip-installed via the ``prismpath.plugins`` entry-point group)
  provide **workers** (tools a flow binds in the document with `@worker(plugin.name)`), **gates**
  (build targets), and **CLI** subcommands. Auditable end to end: `prismpath plugins [--json]`
  lists what's installed and what each provides; `prismpath plugins --check flow.md` verifies every
  binding resolves (CI gate); `registry.worker_agent(graph, default=…)` resolves bindings at
  construction (fail-fast) and stamps dispatched outcomes with `_worker` provenance.
- **The council plugin** (`prismpath/plugins/council/`): the deliberation *expansion* (optional; the
  exception, not the default): `council.roll` (seeded, replayable Oblique-Strategies dice) and
  `council.tally` (coverage/balance-weighted vote tally, deterministic tie-break). `dice.py` moved
  in; a root shim keeps existing imports working.
- **`prismpath init`**: scaffold a starter flow + routing-test table; `init → validate → test` is a
  zero-config, model free first success (the starter's semantic edges light up once
  `[embeddings]` is installed).
- **`@state_bound(transcript=N)`**: a flow-declared sliding-window bound on persisted run state,
  closing the papers' last open critique (unbounded state growth). The engine windows the transcript
  on append and the re-seeded path/step history on resume, so a long lived run's checkpoint payload
  stays flat across unlimited resumes; drops are counted deterministically in `_state_dropped`
  (engine stays pure). Routing is unaffected by construction; predicates read fields plus per node
  `visits`/`error_count` counters, which are never windowed. Malformed bounds fail loudly at run
  start. Engine override: `run(..., max_transcript=N)`.
- **Gate zero delivered**: a human maintainer blind-relabeled all 301 benchmark cases (gold hidden)
  at **Cohen's κ = 0.961 vs gold** ("almost perfect", every stratum ≥ 0.945); an independent
  cross family model (Gemini) agrees with the human at **κ = 0.682** ("substantial"), with 90% of its
  disagreements concentrated where the model dissents alone against human+gold; mostly the polarity
  stratum (44%), the negation trap the benchmark is built to probe. Write-up:
  `prismpath/benchmark/gate_zero/findings.md`; papers and benchmark README updated from "future work" to
  delivered.
- `prismpath/benchmark/make_blind.py`, `prismpath/benchmark/collect_blind.py` (with explicit, audited
  `--drop-invalid` and `--split-compound FLOW/NODE` modes), `prismpath/benchmark/parse_annotate_transcript.py`
 ; the reproducible second-annotator pipeline around `prismpath annotate` / `prismpath kappa`.

- **`docs/decoder-ring.md`: the glossary and repo map.** Every term the papers borrow from
  statistics, formal methods, and distributed systems, explained in plain language: the Wilson
  interval (and why it is read from both ends), selective classification and abstention, δ vs τ,
  Learn-Then-Test and why this is *not* conformal prediction, James-Stein shrinkage, Cohen's κ,
  the match action fragment and one-sided soundness, hexagonal ports, Merkle batching. Plus an
  A to Z glossary, an index of every document / kernel / CLI command / module, and ordered reading
  paths. Caveats travel with their concepts; the κ entry states that 0.961 is the author agreeing
  with the author's own labeling process, not inter-annotator reliability; so a reader who never
  opens a paper still can't over-claim from it.

### Changed
- **Documentation consolidated into a top-level `docs/` tree**: the 12 standalone documents were
  scattered across the repo root, the package dir, and `prismpath/docs/papers/`; they now live in
  `docs/{guides,design,research}/` with kebab-case names. Deliberately *not* moved: files tooling
  reads at the root only (README, LICENSE, CITATION.cff, action.yml), the community-health files
  GitHub surfaces in its UI, SPEC/GETTING_STARTED/ROADMAP as normative text and entry points,
  subsystem READMEs (a README documents its own directory), and program data that merely looks
  like docs (`flows/`, `gallery/`, `nudges/`, `policies/statutory_floor.md`,
  `tests/fixtures/broken/`). `prismpath/docs/` is gone, so the package dir holds only code and
  runtime data. All 12 moves preserve `git log --follow` history; every relative link re-resolved
  (0 broken across 108 files) and 53 bare-path prose citations rewritten.
- **Docs ship in the wheel** under `share/doc/prismpath/`, mirroring the repo layout rather than
  flattened; flattening collides `README.md` with `docs/README.md` and dangles every relative
  cross-doc link. New `MANIFEST.in` carries the same set into sdists.
- **The roblox plugin is gone** (deep excision): the game-dev-origin gate plugin (~9 MB incl. its
  RAG index) was never meant to fuse into PrismPath. The sprint control plane is now fully
  target-generic; the council deliberation expansion stays. `plugins.load_gate` no longer aliases
  `luau`.
- **APP_ARCHITECTURE.md → `prismpath/nudges/`**: it is a coder-prompt contract, not a doc; all
  reference sites now resolve it `__file__`-relative (CWD-independent).

### Fixed
- **The Level M classifier accepted `is`/`is not`; the evaluator rejects them**
  (`prismpath/model_check.py`): `_atom_reason` never checked the comparison operator against the
  evaluator's allowed set, so `verify --level-m` could call an edge table-compilable that
  `eval_condition` refuses as unsafe (the corpus records such predicates as ERROR). Found by the
  hardware target's compiler (the classifier's first external consumer) on its first day.
  Operator gate added + regression rows; check, eval, and classify accept the same language again.
- **CI red on Python 3.10/3.11; a backslash inside an f-string expression** (`prismpath/lsp.py`).
  Legal only on 3.12+, a `SyntaxError` on the older interpreters CI tests against, which aborted
  the entire collection. The expression is hoisted to a variable; the full suite now passes under
  3.11 (verified locally) and the whole package compiles clean under `python3.11 -m compileall`.
- **The wheel was missing files shipped code opens**: `package-data` omitted
  `prismpath/policies/statutory_floor.md` (loaded by `guard`, `measure_p1`, `bypass_report` and
  three test modules) and `prismpath/tests/fixtures/broken/*.md` (read by `test_analysis`). Present
  in the repo, absent from an installed wheel. Both now declared, along with `policies/*.json`.
- **`tools/docs_health.py` failed silently on a stale path**: the evidence-ledger location was
  hardcoded behind an `if os.path.exists(...) else ""`, so a wrong path degraded into reporting
  *every* task and artifact as a coverage gap with no error. Repointed, and it now asserts loudly
  rather than degrading.
- **`tools/arch_guard.py` recreated the directory the reorganization removed**: it wrote its
  scorecard into `prismpath/docs/`. Now writes `docs/design/arch-scorecard.md`, git-ignored, with
  `tools/arch_scorecard.json` remaining the committed artifact. Also caught a genuine **Signal-1
  HARD FAIL** it had not been run against: a Connector SDK docstring used "FPGA", a registered
  sensor-domain noun, inside core. Reworded; Signal-1 passes with 0 violations.
- **The README's headline example did not compile**: the front-page `support_triage` flow routed
  to `billing`, `retention`, and `general` without defining them: three `undefined-target` errors,
  in the showcase for a project whose headline feature is "your flow compiles." The three terminal
  nodes are now present, and the Mermaid beside it is verbatim `prismpath graph` output rather than
  a hand-drawing captioned as tool output. A sweep now validates every self-contained flow snippet
  in the docs; the two paper excerpts it also caught are fixed, and the annotated anatomy diagrams
  in SPEC.md / authoring.md are correctly exempt.
- **The mdflow → prismpath rename had corrupted both papers**: a blanket substitution overwrote a
  *third party's* project name in Related Work ("Lindquist's `prismpath` task runner, unrelated to
  this system"), destroying the attribution and inverting the disambiguation. Restored to `mdflow`
  with a note that explains itself. Also 11 uncopyable commands (`python -m PrismPath.cli`, the
  whitepaper's entire CLI reference block) and two article artifacts ("an PrismPath author"). The
  research paper had been using the correct lowercase form 12 times elsewhere.
- **OTS anchoring read the wrong ledger**: `ledger_ots.from_ledger()` defaulted to the
  pre-rename `refs/mdflow/runs` namespace and `Mdflow-Output-Hash` trailer key, which the ledger
  writer never produces; `prismpath ledger anchor` always found nothing. Now matches `ledger.py`
  exactly (verified against a real ledger). Part of a repo-wide mdflow-leftover sweep that also
  restored the seven `research/` scripts and the compliance adapter's tooling paths.

## [0.1.0] · the initial baseline (pre-release)

The baseline is the whole system; highlights rather than an exhaustive list. (Released
2026-08-06, OpenTimestamps-anchored in Bitcoin block 961224; see the README's "The launch is
anchored"; with a Zenodo DOI in `CITATION.cff`. On the *next* release, [Unreleased] folds
forward into its notes.)

### The format
- **SPEC.md v1 (draft)**: document grammar, the four edge tiers (deterministic / semantic /
  error / event), normative predicate semantics, engine contract, portability levels P0/P1/P2,
  and the synthesizable **match action fragment** (Level M).
- **Frozen conformance vectors** (`prismpath/portable/conformance/`): 1,067 predicate cases + 27 engine
  fixtures, generated deterministically from the reference implementation, enforced in both
  directions in CI. Any runtime that passes them is conformant, by definition.

### The reference implementation
- Pure engine with the routing spectrum; safe predicate evaluator (fuzz-gated: ~20k adversarial
  inputs, zero exec, zero uncaught crash); hybrid embed→LLM routing with margin escalation.
- **Data-plane toolchain**: `validate`/`lint` (16 in graph + 4 cross-flow decidable checks),
  Markdown flow tests, routing lockfile (+ composition-tree pinning, learned-centroid pins),
  risk controlled calibration (Wilson-bound τ), prototype/centroid routing, Mermaid export,
  OTel spans, LangGraph importer, routing-decision label workbench, portability tiering.
- **Durable execution**: atomic checkpoints with flow-hash-bound resume, human queue,
  wait-for-event + reference timeout scheduler, fan-out/sub-flow composition (`@spawn`,
  deterministic child identity, join policies), git Flow-Ledger proof-commits with
  resume-from-ledger.
- **Prefilter cache** with continuous shadow-sampled reuse-error monitoring, windowed drift
  quarantine, and policy hash invalidation.
- **CLI workers** (`cli_worker`): any command-line program as a worker; JSON-on-stdout feeds
  predicates; failures ride the error tier.

### The portable kernel
- `prismpath/portable/prismpath.mjs`; parser + predicate sandbox + engine for the ML-free subset in one
  dependency free ES module (browser/edge/Node), certified against the vectors; the
  **playground** (`prismpath/portable/playground.html`) runs it client-side.

### Measured
- N=300/301 labeled routing suite + reproducible head to head vs LangGraph / CrewAI /
  LLM-router; **hybrid-over-centroids**: 90.0% @ 160 LLM calls/1k, 95.3% @ 360, 98.0% @ 507
  (5-fold CV, shared LLM pass; `prismpath/benchmark/hybrid_sweep.py`); polarity 0.52 → 0.92. Prefilter
  reuse audited live (97% oracle agreement, zero unsafe downgrades).
