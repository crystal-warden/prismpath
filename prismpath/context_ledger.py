"""context_ledger.py — attest WHAT a frozen model was conditioned on.

For a hardwired / frozen-weights model, the weights are fixed silicon: the CONTEXT (system prompt,
retrieved documents, conversation turns — the material that becomes the KV cache) is the only
mutable state left, and therefore the governance surface. This module makes that surface
attestable: an append-only ledger of context segments, each committed by content hash and chained,
rolled into a Merkle root, and bound into the SAME provenance manifest the rest of the attestation
stack uses (`ledger_airgap.provenance_manifest` — zero new manifest machinery).

Privacy is structural: the ledger stores HASHES, never content. A low-entropy segment (a short
command, a yes/no) can be committed salted (`ledger_airgap.salt_leaf`, C4) so a leaked artifact
cannot be confirmed by guessing the text.

The claim this earns: "this answer was produced by policy P over EXACTLY this context" — the
manifest binds the context root (what was in the window), the segment hashes (order and identity),
the policy hash (which flow governed), the gate id, and the model identity, all content-addressed
and tamper-evident (`verify_manifest`).

Mirrored bit-for-bit in the Rust kernel (`prismpath-rs::durable::ContextLedger`), gated by the
frozen cross-language fixtures in `portable/conformance/context.json`.
