"""guard_semantic.py — the OPTIONAL P1 layer above the deterministic floor.

P0 (`guard.py`) is a grammar: bypass is inexpressible, the guarantee is hardware-invariant, and every
compliance claim rests on it. P1 is a *measurement* tier — semantic similarity to prohibited-intent
centroids, for the paraphrase and euphemism classes a grammar provably cannot reach
(`docs/research/bypass-measurement.md`, semantic strata at 1.00).

THREE RULES THIS LAYER OBEYS
----------------------------
1. **Claims attach to the floor, not the ceiling.** P1 needs an embedder, which the 8 GB floor tier
   does not have — so its availability is *tier-conditional* and no compliance claim may rest on it.
   Saying "our safety classification is stronger on expensive computers" is the sentence that fails in
   front of a regulator; P0 is what is claimed, and P0 runs everywhere.

2. **Fail to floor, loudly, attested.** If the embedder cannot be verified against the lockfile, P1
   **disables**. It does not run unverified. Because the claim already rests on P0, losing P1 breaches
   nothing — fail-to-floor is claim-preserving by construction. Running an unverified classifier would
   manufacture decisions that cannot be attested, which is worse than absence: it pollutes the audit
   trail with false confidence. Refuse over guess is the house pattern (the P0 kernel refuses non-P0
   flows rather than approximating them).

3. **Composition is union-only.** P1 can add a denial; it can never remove one. `check()` consults P0
   first and returns its verdict unchanged if it denied — so P1 cannot overturn the floor, cannot
   re-attribute a floor denial, and cannot become a path around the grammar.

WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------
Not a claim-bearing layer. Not available on the floor tier. Not deterministic across machines in the
way P0 is: it is pinned by a lockfile and verified by fingerprint, which converts silent numeric drift
into a loud, policy-controlled signal — that is drift *detection*, not identical arithmetic on
arbitrary hardware.

        `{"a": [1.0, 2.0]}` and goes exponential below 1e-4 (`9.6e-05`), JavaScript writes
        `{"a":[1,2]}` and holds out until 1e-7. The TypeScript port replicated Python's formatting
        character by character to compensate — which means any third implementation would have hit
        the same wall, and the parity test was pinning an accident. Hashing the IEEE-754 bits removes
        formatting from the preimage entirely: both consumers parse the same lockfile JSON, decimal→
        binary parsing is correctly rounded in every language that matters, so they hold identical
        doubles and identity holds by construction.

        Deliberate semantic change from v1: no rounding before hashing. Two layers whose centroids
        differ only in the 7th decimal are different numbers and therefore different boundaries —
