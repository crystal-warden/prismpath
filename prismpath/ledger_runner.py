"""ledger_runner.py — drive a routing flow as a per-item loop with a git proof per item (Slice 2).

The sprint control plane (run_sprint.py) already has a gate-green seam to hang the Flow-Ledger on.
A *routing* flow (SOC triage, ticket queues) doesn't — it runs `engine.run` once per item and
edits no code. This runner gives those flows the same durable-proof + resume story:

  * A flow marks ONE node with `@checkpoint(unit=<state-key>, proof=<state-key>, gate=<field>)` —
    the node whose success means "this item is fully handled." `unit` is the ITEM id (an alert /
    ticket id from runtime state, NOT the node name, which collides across items); `proof` is the
    produced artifact to content-hash; `gate` (optional) is an outcome field that must be truthy.
  * `run_ledgered_loop` runs the flow once per item; when the checkpoint node is reached (and its
    gate is green) it writes one proof-commit for that item.
  * RESUME-FROM-LEDGER: each pass seeds `state['_done_units']` from `ledger.done_set()`, so the
    flow's own `observe`/`fetch` node skips items already proven in git. A run stopped mid-stream
    restarts at the first item with no green commit — no separate processed-list to keep in sync.

`upsert_jsonl` makes a side-effecting handler idempotent so a replayed item doesn't double-append.
