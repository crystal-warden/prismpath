"""sprint_flow.py — the sprint loop AS A FLOW (roadmap item #6, the dogfood).

`run_sprint.py`'s inner loop — pick unit, execute, gate, retry ×3, escalate — was a fixed
Python loop orchestrating prismpath. This module runs the SAME loop as `flows/sprint_loop.md`:
gates route on deterministic fields, the 3×-same-error rule is an `on error when
error_count >= …` edge, escalation is an ordinary `needs_human` suspension, and every
gate-green unit is a `@checkpoint` proof-commit in the git Flow-Ledger. The control plane
that builds prismpath is itself an prismpath flow — the credibility argument, self-demonstrating.

The concrete work (what "pick"/"build"/"gate"/"fix"/"escalate" DO) stays out of the flow, in
a `SprintSeams` bundle of callables over the run state:

    seams = SprintSeams(pick=..., build=..., gate=..., fix=..., escalate=...)
    committed = run_sprint_flow(seams, ledger=Ledger("sprint", run_id))

`run_sprint.py` builds its seams from its existing machinery (kg_next,
cecli_build/build, validate_fn, help_escalate) behind SPRINT_FLOW=1 — same behavior, but the
loop's SEMANTICS now live in the document, inspectable by `prismpath validate`/`graph` like any
other flow, while the wall-clock / pause / heartbeat machinery stays in the driver where
harness concerns belong.
