"""composer.py — the fan-out / sub-flow composition harness (roadmap item #4).

The engine suspends a fan-out node as `waiting` and records a `spawn` DATA spec in the checkpoint
(engine.py stays PURE — it spawns nothing, does no I/O). This module is the out-of-band harness that
acts on that spec, mirroring `scheduler.fire_due_timeouts` exactly: a dependency-free, RESTARTABLE
scan — no daemon — that

  1. finds `waiting` parent checkpoints carrying a `spawn` spec,
  2. runs one DURABLE child run per item (an ordinary `run_durable` checkpoint) under a DETERMINISTIC
     id — so a harness restart re-derives the same ids and NEVER double-spawns; a child already
     terminal is skipped, a crashed child is resumed, a child blocked on its own event/human is left,
  3. when the join condition holds (`all_done` for now; `quorum:k` in a later tranche), aggregates the
     child terminal outcomes into the parent's state and resumes the parent by delivering the join
     event via `checkpoint.resume(event=...)` — taking the parent's `-> …: on event all_done` edge.

Concurrency MECHANICS live here; fan-in SEMANTICS live in the flow document (the `on event` edges the
engine already routes on). Sub-flow composition is the N==1 case of the same code path. The git ledger
dedups child UNITS across parents for free (a child flow's per-unit proof is shared by every fan-out
that spawns it — see ledger_runner).

    from prismpath import composer
    acted = composer.advance_fanouts(agent)     # scan the default queue once; spawn/poll/join

This is the reference harness (single process, sequential child stepping) — not a production
scheduler (which would add real concurrency, leasing, and at-least-once delivery). The durability and
idempotency guarantees are what make those safe to add later.
