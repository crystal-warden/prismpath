"""routelog.py — a durable log of routing decisions (Sprint 0), and a labeling workbench.

Every semantic-tier routing decision a run makes can be appended to a JSONL file: the outcome, the
candidate edges with their scores, the margin, what was chosen, whether it escalated. That log is
the raw material for calibrating the escalation threshold (Area 1) and for growing the benchmark
(Area 4) from *real* runs rather than only synthetic cases. The engine stays pure — it emits each
record through the `on_decision` callback; this module supplies the sink and the workbench.

  run_logged(graph, agent, "routes.jsonl")   # run, appending a record per semantic decision
  # then hand-label the unlabeled records:
  python -m prismpath.cli label routes.jsonl

A record (see engine.run) has: run_id, flow, node, outcome_text, outcome_fields, candidates
[{target, condition, score}], top1, top2, margin, chosen, mechanism, escalated, llm_choice, label,
label_source. `label` is filled in later by a human (or `flow_test`), turning a run into training
data.
