"""The make-or-break test: does embedding routing pick the RIGHT edge?

For the bugfix flow we hand-label realistic agent outcomes with the edge they SHOULD take,
including the hard logical-polarity cases ("all tests pass" vs "some tests still fail") that
are topically near-identical. We compare:
  (1) EMBED   — cosine(outcome, edge-condition) argmax  (the proposal)
  (2) LEXICAL — token-overlap argmax                     (a trivial baseline)
and report accuracy + every failure, so we can see exactly where embeddings break.
