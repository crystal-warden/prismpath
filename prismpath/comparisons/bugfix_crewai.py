"""bugfix_crewai.py — the `bugfix` flow expressed in CrewAI, as an Area-5 baseline.

Reference implementation (requires `pip install crewai`; NOT run in this repo's CI — it needs an
LLM and CrewAI installed). Its purpose is the comparison, not execution: it shows *where CrewAI's
control flow lives* versus prismpath's.

CrewAI has two paradigms; neither closes the gap prismpath occupies.

1. Crews (Agent / Task / Process.sequential | hierarchical). The sequential process is rigid
   turn-taking: task 1 -> task 2 -> task 3, no conditional branching on a semantic outcome at all.
   You cannot say "if the bug is a duplicate, close; else implement" without leaving the model.
   The hierarchical process delegates routing to a manager LLM — flexible, but non-deterministic
   and unauditable (the manager decides, opaquely, every time).

2. Flows (crewai.flow: @start / @listen / @router) — the paradigm used below, because it is the
   *fairer* comparison: CrewAI Flows CAN branch. But the routing lives in **Python `@router`
   methods** — imperative code that inspects state and returns a label. That is exactly
   LangGraph's problem restated: the control flow is code, not a readable artifact; there are no
   per-edge conditions a PM can read; there is no deterministic/semantic tier distinction; and
   there is no routing-cost model. A bad route traces to a Python method, not to a heading and a
   condition in a document.

Contrast — the same routing in prismpath (`flows/bugfix.md`) is authored, diffable prose:

    ## triage
    -> implement: the bug is reproduced and the root cause is clear
    -> gather_info: it cannot be reproduced or more information is needed
    -> close: it is a duplicate or an invalid report

    ## implement
    -> review: when tests_pass
    -> implement: when visits < 4 and not tests_pass
    -> triage: a design decision is required before continuing

prismpath routes those with deterministic `when` predicates (free, exact) and embedding similarity
for the intent edges (escalating to one LLM call only on low margin). CrewAI has neither the
readable per-edge condition nor the cost model — see comparisons/README.md.
