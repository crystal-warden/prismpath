"""checkpoint.py — durable execution for prismpath (Area 6, Slice 0: the JSON checkpoint).

The engine (engine.py) is pure and its `state` is ephemeral — thrown away when run() returns.
This module makes a run DURABLE and RESUMABLE without ever touching the read-only flow `.md`:
it serializes the run's state to a JSON sidecar (atomic os.replace) at each step and at a
suspension point, and resumes by RE-PARSING the read-only `.md` and re-entering the engine with
the restored state.

  run_durable(flow, agent, ckpt)         # run, checkpointing every step
  resume(ckpt, agent)                     # after a crash: re-enter at the pending node, re-run it
  resume(ckpt, agent, choose="stage_x")   # after a needs_human suspension: apply the human's edge

Design guarantees:
  * The flow `.md` is NEVER written — durable state lives only in the sidecar. The single
    read-only-source invariant is preserved (indeed this is why we checkpoint to JSON, not to a
    checkbox back in the doc).
  * Deterministic replay: same checkpoint + same choice => identical continuation (the engine's
    deterministic-first routing is a pure function of the restored state).
  * Off the critical path: if the state is not JSON-serializable, checkpointing disables itself
    with a warning rather than breaking the run.
