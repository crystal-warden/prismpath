"""The graph engine: a LangGraph replacement driven by a markdown graph.

run(graph, worker): start at graph.start; at each node, hand the worker the node instruction
and running state; the worker returns an OUTCOME (a string, or a dict with structured fields
plus 'text'). Routing then chooses the next node by a SPECTRUM:
  1. DETERMINISTIC edges (`-> target: condition`) are evaluated against the outcome fields (+ a
     `visits` counter) - first match wins. Logic where logic exists.
  2. Otherwise, the SEMANTIC edges are routed by the router (embedding / hybrid / LLM) over
     the outcome text. Intent where logic doesn't.
Repeat until a terminal node (no edges), a stuck state, needs_human, or max_steps.

The worker is any callable (node, instruction, state) -> outcome, so the engine is independent
of who runs the work (a real LLM agent, the swarm, a pipeline coder, a mock, a shell step).
The second parameter was called `agent` before the dictionary settled on worker; `agent=` still
works as a deprecated keyword alias, and no first party caller uses it.

Suspension (durable execution: see prismpath.checkpoint). The engine is PURE (no I/O of its own):
  * A run suspends with stopped=='needs_human' when the worker asks for a human (it returns a
    dict with `needs_human` truthy) OR a semantic route's confidence falls below `human_floor`.
    `RunResult.pending` then carries the decision awaiting a human (node + candidate edges + any
    scores). The absolute-score floor becomes a first-class "route this to a person" outcome.
  * A run can RE-ENTER mid-graph via `start=` and a restored `state=` (so a checkpoint can resume
    without ever touching the read-only .md), and an `on_step` callback lets a caller persist a
    checkpoint at each step. The engine itself neither reads nor writes any file.
