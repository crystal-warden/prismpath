"""The security half of the onion — a deterministic, non-weakenable safety boundary.

PrismPath's onion is security + observability wrapped around the engine. The observability half
already exists (`audit_log.py`, `ledger*.py`, attestation). This is the security half.

WHY IT IS A LAYER AND NOT AN ADAPTER
------------------------------------
A safety boundary that any one domain can define is not a boundary. This is cross-cutting: every
adapter inherits it and none can bypass it, so it lives in the core and carries **no domain nouns**
(`tools/arch_guard.py` Signal-1 is a hard fail on those). It speaks of policies, principals, text and
verdicts — never of any particular application.

SCOPE — AN OPTIONAL FLOOR, NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER
-----------------------------------------------
Content safety is primarily the model's responsibility (and its provider's moderation), not the routing
layer's. This guard is an OPTIONAL deterministic floor for the case the model can't be trusted (a weak
or absent local model); it
is deliberately NOT embedded in the portable Rust/Go/JS kernels. PrismPath owns provable routing and
governed code execution (the code-node sandbox); content safety is delegated. See
`docs/design/spec-guard-onion.md` §1.5.

THE TWO-AUTHOR MODEL
--------------------
Two different people with two different jobs write policy:

* A **safety owner** writes the *floor* — the statutory controls that must hold everywhere, authored
  once, centrally, by whoever actually tracks the regulatory landscape.
* A **flow author** writes *augmentations* — the runtime guardrails they can think of while authoring
  their own content, and any extra strictness their domain demands.

MONOTONICITY IS ENFORCED BY THE GRAMMAR, NOT BY A CHECK
-------------------------------------------------------
The obvious risk in letting flow authors touch safety is that one of them weakens it. So the policy
language **has no verb for permitting**. There is `deny` and nothing else. An augmentation can only
ever add denials; composing policies is a union. Weakening the floor is not "disallowed and checked
for" — it is *unsayable*. That is a much stronger guarantee than a validation pass, because there is
no expression for a reviewer to miss and no code path to get wrong.

DETERMINISTIC BY CONSTRUCTION (P0)
----------------------------------
Evaluation is literal and regex matching only — no model, no embeddings. The weakest device runs the
weakest model, so the guarantee has to be strongest exactly where the model is least trustworthy. A
guard that asked a small local model whether something was safe would be weakest precisely when it
matters most.

FAIL CLOSED
-----------
A malformed policy raises rather than being skipped, and a guard cannot be built without a floor. A
safety layer that silently degrades to permissive is worse than none, because it is trusted.

Policy documents are Markdown, so the people who write them can read them:

    ---
    name: statutory-floor
    authority: safety-owner
    precedence: floor
    ---

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- normalization
#
# Measured bypass rates (docs/research/bypass-measurement.md, run 1) showed the unhardened floor was defeated by
# purely mechanical surface changes: zero-width characters, combining accents, Cyrillic homoglyphs,
# character spacing. Those are *normalization* problems, not semantic ones, so they can be closed
# here — inside P0, with the floor still a grammar and bypass still inexpressible rather than merely
# detectable.
#
# TWO PROPERTIES THIS MUST PRESERVE:
#
# 1. **Normalization is monotone.** A rule matches if it matches the raw text OR the normalized
#    text. Folding can therefore only ever ADD matches. If matching used the normalized form alone,
#    a fold that happened to destroy a pattern would silently *weaken* the floor — reintroducing the
#    exact hole the "no permitting verb" grammar exists to prevent, through the back door.
# 2. **It is part of the policy's identity.** The folding tables are hashed into `Guard.policy_hash`,
#    so an attested verdict commits to *which* normalization produced it. Changing a table changes
#    the hash, the same way changing a rule does.
#
# Order matters and is fixed: invisibles are stripped first (they sit between the characters every
# later step reads), then compatibility normalization, then accent removal, then confusable folding,
# then the lossy heuristics.

    This is the shim in the literal sense: it sits *between* the principal and whatever answers them.
    Inbound text is checked **before** `call` happens, so denied input never reaches the model at all;
    the response is checked before it is returned, so denied output never reaches the principal.

    The safe path is the only path worth taking here, so the signature makes it the easy one: a guard
    is a required positional argument, not an option with a permissive default. There is no
    `guarded_exchange(text, call)` overload that quietly skips the boundary, and an adapter that wants
    a model response has nothing simpler to reach for.

    `on_verdict(verdict, text)` receives every verdict, allowed or not, together with the text it was
    made about — wire it to `guard_ledger.verdict_recorder` so the observability half of the onion
    records what the security half decided. Allowed verdicts matter as much as denials: a trail
    containing only refusals cannot distinguish "the guard ran and permitted this" from "the guard
    never ran". `guard.policy_hash` binds which rules AND which normalization produced the answer.

    Raises `Blocked` rather than returning a sentinel, so a caller that forgets to check cannot
    accidentally treat a refusal as a normal answer.
