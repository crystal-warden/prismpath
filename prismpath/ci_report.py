"""ci_report.py — the PR report: validate + fixtures + before/after Mermaid for changed flows.

`prismpath ci-report --base <ref>` finds the flow files changed since `<ref>`, runs the decidable
checks and the fixture tables on each, renders the flow's graph BEFORE (the base version) and
AFTER (the working tree) as Mermaid — which GitHub renders natively in a PR comment — and prints
one Markdown report. The GitHub Action posts it as a sticky comment; locally it's just a command.

This is the "money demo" as a living product: a PR that edits an edge shows its topology diff and
its routing-test verdict *in the conversation*, so a reviewer approves a process change the way
they approve code. Exit status: 1 if any changed flow has an error-severity finding or a failing
fixture row (the comment is information; the exit code is the gate).

Model-free by design: validate and the deterministic fixture rows need no model; fixture tables
whose rows hit the embedding tier are reported as "skipped (needs the [embeddings] extra)" rather
than failing the report on a kernel-only CI runner.
