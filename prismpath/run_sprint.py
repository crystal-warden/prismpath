"""Generic TIMED + SUPERVISED agent build sprint — a 5-ROLE pipeline on the served model.

Evolves the old builder+critic loop into separated roles with hard boundaries (the architect never
builds; the coder never validates its own work):

  ARCHITECT  designs only  -> a persisted BLUEPRINT.md (file manifest + port contracts). No code.
  CODER      implements the blueprint (ideate + one critic-chosen feature per turn). No tests, no
             self-grading. Can remove a file with a `DELETE: <path>` line.
  TEST-AUTHOR writes/maintains the headless specs (the behavioral validation) — independent of the
             implementation. Owns specs; never touches impl. (Only when the gate has a spec layer.)
  GATE       deterministic validation (syntax/type/build/logic).  [gates.py / a gate plugin]
  FIXER      makes the SMALLEST change to satisfy the gate (impl only; specs are the authoritative
             contract — it conforms code to them, never edits them).
  CRITIC     reviews quality + architecture + blueprint adherence; picks the next step or says DONE.

Flow:  nudge -> ARCHITECT -(blueprint)-> CODER -(code)-> TEST-AUTHOR -(specs)-> GATE -> CRITIC -> loop

Runs on a WALL CLOCK (open-ended until a STOP file, or until the critic says DONE and the gate is
green), and escalates hard problems to a HELP.md file a supervisor answers out-of-band.

Help escalation has TWO triggers:
  1. agent-declared — any role emits a line `HELP_NEEDED: <specific question>`
  2. auto-detected  — the gate returns the SAME error signature N times in a row (default 3)
On escalation the driver appends an OPEN block to HELP.md and KEEPS WORKING. A supervisor adds an
`## ANSWER <id>` block; the driver injects it into the next turn, marks RESOLVED, and resumes.

Config (env):
  LLM_BASE, LLM_MODEL          served OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  SPRINT_PROJ                  output project dir (required)
  SPRINT_ARCH                  architecture contract file (default prismpath/nudges/APP_ARCHITECTURE.md)
  SPRINT_NUDGE | SPRINT_NUDGE_FILE   the goal (required; file wins if both set)
  SPRINT_GATE                  "browser" (default) | a gate-plugin name
  SPRINT_SECONDS               wall-clock budget; 0/unset = open-ended (until STOP file)
  SPRINT_MAX_NEW               generation budget per call (default 12000)
  SPRINT_STUCK_REPEAT          identical-error repeats before auto-escalate (default 3)
  SPRINT_EXTEND                "1" to build on an existing SPRINT_PROJ (default 0 — else it must be empty)
