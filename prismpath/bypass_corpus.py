"""bypass_corpus.py — stratified adversarial variants of the seeds the P0 floor claims to deny.

Protocol is pre-registered in `docs/research/bypass-measurement.md`; this module implements it and must not
deviate from it silently. Mechanical strata are generated deterministically (same input, same
output, no sampling); semantic strata are hand-authored and are therefore a small, disclosed sample.

This exists to *measure* a safety control, which means producing text designed to slip past it. The
seeds come from the frozen conformance corpus — they are exactly what the floor already claims to
stop — and nothing here is elaborated beyond what is needed to vary a phrase's surface form.
