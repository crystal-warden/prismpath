"""Routing-accuracy mini-evals for the new example flows.

For each flow we hand-label realistic agent outcomes with the SEMANTIC edge they should take
(deterministic `when` edges are exact by construction, so they're excluded from the accuracy
number — we only score the genuinely-semantic transitions the router has to judge). We report
EmbeddingRouter accuracy per flow, and optionally HybridRouter accuracy if a local LLM is
available (skipped by default to keep the eval cheap/CPU-only).
