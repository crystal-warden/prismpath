"""gen_safety_conformance.py — freeze the guard's safety boundary as language-neutral vectors.

`guard.py` is the security half of the onion. Journeyman needs the same boundary in TypeScript, and
any future adapter may need it in another language — so the boundary is exported as committed DATA,
generated from the PYTHON reference, and any implementation can be validated bit-for-bit with nothing
but a JSON reader:

    python -m prismpath.portable.gen_safety_conformance   # regenerate (deterministic)
    node portable/run_safety_vectors.mjs                  # verify a port against the vectors

Why this matters more here than for predicates: a safety boundary that quietly differs between
implementations is worse than no boundary, because it is *trusted*. If the TypeScript guard blocks
something the Python one allows, that is a UX bug; if it allows something Python blocks, that is a
hole in a control someone is relying on. The corpus makes both directions measurable.

The corpus is SELF-CONTAINED: it embeds the policy documents themselves, so every implementation
parses the identical source rather than a paraphrase. A port that reads this file needs no access to
the PrismPath tree.

Case classes (deliberately including the negatives):
  * every floor rule, in every direction it declares
  * NEAR-MISSES that must stay allowed — the floor is deliberately narrow, and over-blocking is the
    failure mode that gets a safety layer switched off
  * direction scoping (a rule that is outbound-only must not fire inbound)
  * monotonicity: the same probes under floor-only and floor+augmentation, so a port that composes
    incorrectly is caught
  * literal-vs-regex semantics and case-insensitivity
  * empty text

Determinism: sorted iteration, no RNG — regenerating on the same source produces a byte-identical
file, so `git diff` over it IS the boundary-change review.

An augmentation a flow author might plausibly add. Present here to pin that composing it ADDS a
denial without removing any floor denial.

## outbound-only-marker
Pins direction scoping across implementations.

## overlaps-the-floor
Deliberately matches text the FLOOR also denies. Pins that floor rules are attributed first, so a
port that sorts augmentations ahead of the floor reports the wrong policy and citation — the
citation is what a user-facing refusal and an audit record are built from.
