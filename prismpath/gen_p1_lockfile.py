"""gen_p1_lockfile.py — freeze the P1 semantic layer's operating parameters.

The layer is only trustworthy if the thing it consults is pinned. This emits everything a consumer
needs to run P1 with the behaviour that was actually MEASURED, and nothing it could vary:

  * the prohibited-intent **centroids**, computed from exemplars authored independently of the
    acceptance corpus (`assert_disjoint_from` enforces that);
  * the **fingerprint** — the reference embedding of a fixed probe. A consumer whose embedder does
    not reproduce it fails to floor rather than running unverified;
  * the **threshold**, and the measurement it comes from, so the number is never a guess;
  * the **embedder identity**, including runtime and precision, because the same weights under a
    different runtime are a different numeric contract.

    python -m prismpath.gen_p1_lockfile            # write the lockfile
    python -m prismpath.gen_p1_lockfile --check    # verify the committed one is current

Vectors are stored as plain float arrays rather than base64: they are small (4 x 384), and a
lockfile a reviewer can read is worth more here than a compact one they cannot.
