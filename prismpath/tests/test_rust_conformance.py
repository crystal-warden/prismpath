"""The Rust kernel must stay CONFORMANT — certification as a gate, not an event.

`prismpath-rs` was certified against the frozen vectors on 2026-07-29 and re-verified on every run
(now 1079/1079 predicates, 27/27 flows — `prismpath-rs/CONFORMANCE.md`). A one-time certificate decays the moment either
side changes; running the binary here makes drift a red test instead of a discovery. Together
with `test_portable_conformance.py` (Python ↔ .mjs) and `test_conformance_vectors.py` (vectors ↔
live Python), every implementation is re-certified on every pytest run.

Skips cleanly where cargo is not installed — the .mjs and Python gates still run there, and the
Rust gate runs wherever the crate can build at all.
