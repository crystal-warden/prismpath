"""Regression: a gate whose own machinery crashes must not report a clean pass.

Found in the September 2026 readability review: behavioral_check caught any exception from the
browser harness, printed "gate infra error (skipped)" and returned no errors, so a broken gate
looked like a passing one. The deliberate skip when playwright is not installed stays; a crash
after the gate has started is a failed gate.
