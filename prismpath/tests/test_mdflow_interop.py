"""mdflow interop — the paper's "composes naturally as a node's worker" claim, gated.

Related Work (paper §2) says a task-level Markdown runner like Lindquist's `mdflow` "can serve
as a node's worker through the generic CLI-worker contract ... while our system routes between
tasks by outcome." This test enforces that claim end-to-end: a PrismPath flow routes BETWEEN
mdflow tasks, each task run as a CLI worker, with the task's stdout JSON feeding `when`
predicates and a task's nonzero exit landing on the error tier.

Honesty boundary: the worker here is `mock_mdflow.py`, a stub reconstructed from mdflow's
DOCUMENTED contract (see examples/mdflow_interop/README.md), not the real binary. This gates the
*mechanism*; validation against the real tool is the open item (and the reason for the outreach).
