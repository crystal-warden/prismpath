"""Drift guards — pin the numbers the FPGA/eBPF declared-subset claims derive from, so a corpus or
classifier change turns a test RED instead of silently making a published number wrong.

The number chain over the frozen `predicates.json` (1079 vectors, corpus v2):
  * **136 cases / 126 distinct conditions** are Level M per `model_check.is_level_m` — the in-package
    CLASSIFIER authority (what `verify --level-m` and `capability_report` use). Pinned here (CI-run).
    Chained comparisons are normalized into the fragment (SPEC §4.3): the classifier desugars
    `a < b < c` -> `a < b and b < c` via the SAME `_desugar_chains` the PPT compiler imports, so the two
    share one definition and cannot disagree. Float constants are rejected — the i32 fragment has no
    float value domain, so `field OP <float>` is not table-compilable; a signed INTEGER literal folds
    into the fragment (SPEC §4.3, `predicates.fold_unary_signs`), a signed float or field does not.
  * The PPT compiler (`prismpath-hw/ppt_compile`) accepts the SAME 126 distinct conditions — **0
    classifier-vs-compiler disagreements** over the corpus (pinned by `test_classifier_compiler_gap_pinned`).
  * **124** of the 1079 vectors are runnable on the i32 table (in-fragment condition AND read fields
    representable) — the declared subset the FPGA **C target** certifies (asserted where the cert runs;
    needs interp) and the **eBPF** target certifies **in-kernel** (124/124, re-certified 2026-08-12 on
    aarch64 + x86_64 with the hardened loader). The **RTL** still certifies **114/1067** (corpus v1);
    its re-sweep to 124/1079 for the negative-integer literals is pending a hardware retest.

Why this file exists: an eBPF cert once reported 66 from an over-strict context filter and nothing caught
it (reconciled to 114 to match the FPGA). These pins make the next such drift loud.
