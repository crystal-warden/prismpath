"""'Run any program as a worker' (docs/guides/workers.md), proven with two language workers, all on one contract (read stdin, print one JSON object, exit 0; a nonzero exit -> error tier):

  - Python  ci_gate.py      : a CI test / coverage gate
  - Rust    ci_gate.rs      : the SAME gate, second language (one job ports across languages, no flow change)

Python always runs. Rust runs only if rustc is installed, so a Python only run still
exercises the contract via the Python worker, and the compiled workers are recertified anywhere their
compiler exists."""
