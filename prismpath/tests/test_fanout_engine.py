"""Tranche 1 of roadmap item #4 (fan-out & sub-flow composition): the ENGINE side.

The engine's whole contribution to fan-out is a single, pure passthrough: a worker that returns
{"wait": True, "spawn": <data spec>} suspends as an ordinary `waiting` node AND the spawn spec is
recorded in RunResult.pending — so the durable checkpoint carries everything the out-of-band harness
(composer.py) needs, while the engine itself spawns nothing and does no I/O. These tests pin exactly
that contract with stub agents (no model, no network, no child runs yet).
