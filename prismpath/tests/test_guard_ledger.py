"""Tests for wiring guard verdicts into the attested trail.

The load-bearing assertions are about what the trail *binds* and what it *refuses to leak*: an entry
that records a refusal without recording which policy produced it is not an audit record, and an
entry that lets a bystander recover the learner's prompt is a privacy defect wearing an audit badge.
