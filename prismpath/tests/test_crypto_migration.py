"""Fleet-migration replay (spec-crypto-agility.md §10.5): the monotone-migration property,
characterized as a (policy-gate k x envelope-floor f) matrix and replayed from the frozen corpus.

The property: a policy that gates the classical suite at phase k satisfies P4 for every floor f >= k
and provably violates it for every f < k. The corpus must reproduce byte-for-byte, and the f>=k
invariant must hold in every cell — so the suite can never silently degrade into a vacuous all-pass."""
