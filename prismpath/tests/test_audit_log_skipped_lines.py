"""Regression: an unparseable line in the audit log is not silently dropped.

Found in the September 2026 readability review: a truncated or edited JSONL line was skipped with a bare
except and the log then verified clean over the survivors. A reader of the log must be told, and
verify_log must not call a log with holes in it intact.
