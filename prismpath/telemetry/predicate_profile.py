"""profile.py  -  the predicate profile behind a Facet symbol (escalation rung one).

A symbol on the wire is a cell index: the minimum sufficient statistic for the policy's
decisions. When a consumer needs to look closer, the first rung of escalation is not raw data,
it is THIS: the cell's full membership (the interval or category the value fell in), the policy
atoms that cut that field's domain, and each atom's truth over the cell  -  everything the
decision layer knew, still derived entirely from the signed policy, still zero raw readings.

This module is pure introspection over the codebook (`build_partitions`): nothing is
transmitted, retained, or invented. The wire cost accounting (`profile_wire_bytes`) exists so
that "bytes promoted" is a measured quantity from day one: a symbol costs a few bits, its
profile costs tens of bytes, and that ratio is the price of rung one.
