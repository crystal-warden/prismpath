"""The concentrator profile (PROTOCOL.md section 2.9): many streams, one datagram.

A 2-3 byte decision inside a ~28 byte IP+UDP envelope is header-dominated; a bridge that uplinks
a fleet amortizes that envelope by concatenating records from many streams into one datagram.
The concentrated frame stays zero-header in the Facet sense: a record is
``[stream_id][reading]`` where the stream id is itself Zeckendorf-coded (ids from 1) and the
reading carries no length because the stream's codebook fixes its field count (I3 does the
framing). Records pack bit-contiguously; only the datagram is padded to the byte.

The demultiplexer is strict and fail-closed over the whole datagram: an unknown stream id, a
record truncated mid-reading, or a trailing partial that is not zero pad rejects the datagram
with a distinct cause (``concentrator-unknown-stream``, ``concentrator-truncated``)  -  never a
partial delivery, because a datagram that demuxes differently at two consumers is worse than a
lost one.

The registry mapping stream id to field count is derived from each stream's signed policy
(``len(build_partitions(policy))``) and agreed out of band exactly like the codebook itself.
