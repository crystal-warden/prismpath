"""Zeckendorf / Fibonacci codec — the self-framing wire for the decision-preserving telemetry stream.

Every positive integer has a unique Zeckendorf representation (a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci
numbers), so its bit pattern never contains ``11``. The Fibonacci code appends a terminal ``1``, making a
trailing ``11`` that appears nowhere else — a permanent, data-agnostic codeword boundary. Variable-length,
prefix-free, ``O(log n)``, and densest on small integers (``1 -> 11``, ``2 -> 011``, ``3 -> 0011``,
``4 -> 1011``), which is exactly where delta-differenced telemetry lives.

Fibonacci coding is defined for POSITIVE integers (n >= 1). Callers that need to send 0 or signed deltas
offset/zig-zag at the symbol layer, not here — this module stays the pure, doc-faithful wire.

Reference (bit-string) implementation for Phase A: correctness + measurement first. The u64-accumulate
CPU path and the FPGA shift-register codec are Phase C.
