"""calibrate.py — turn the escalation threshold δ into a *risk-controlled* τ with a guarantee (Area 1).

The margin (top-1 − top-2 similarity) is a confidence score; escalating to the LLM is abstention.
This is **risk-controlled selective classification**: given a calibration set of labeled routing
decisions, find the smallest threshold τ such that decisions the router does NOT escalate
(margin ≥ τ) are correct at rate ≥ 1−α — certified by a finite-sample (Wilson) *lower* bound, so
the guarantee holds beyond the calibration sample. δ becomes *derived*, not chosen.

This is **not conformal prediction** — there is no nonconformity-score quantile and no exchangeable
prediction-set construction. The method is a single-threshold instance of the Learn-Then-Test /
Risk-Controlling-Prediction-Sets family (Angelopoulos, Bates, et al.); the Wilson lower bound is the
finite-sample certificate. We use "risk-controlled selective escalation", not "conformal", by design.

Assumption (stated so it can be checked): the Wilson bound treats the calibration decisions as an
i.i.d.-ish sample of deployment routing. Mixing authored *test fixtures* (which are not deployment
traffic) with real routelogs weakens that — prefer deployment `prismpath label` records, or report the
two sources separately.

    recs = routelog.load_records("routes.jsonl")   # labeled by `prismpath label` or flow_test
    cal = calibrate(recs, alpha=0.05)               # -> {tau, n, tau_n_kept, tau_acc_lower, curve, ...}
    router = RiskControlledHybridRouter(LLMRouter(gen), calibration=cal)   # runtime = HybridRouter at τ
