"""Governed worker demo (SAMPLE) -- a fixed, scripted illustration (also a regression test), not a
configure-and-run tool. Gates decide, claims are advisory, a lying worker is caught.

Three simulated worker runs go through the governed_worker flow. No model, no network, fully
deterministic; the "worker" is a stub whose claim and whose actual gate outcomes we script. The
interesting case is the liar: it claims success while the gates fail, and the flow routes it to
``reject_lie`` where the claim is recorded and nothing merges.

    PYTHONPATH=prismpath/examples/governed_worker \
      python prismpath/examples/governed_worker/run_demo.py

Requires Linux + bwrap (the code-node sandbox). Exits nonzero if any verdict is wrong, so this
demo doubles as its own regression test.
