"""Hermes role-swarm — one memory-forming Hermes agent per role, all on local gemma4.

Each role is a separate `$HERMES_HOME` (its own persistent memory / skills / sessions, seeded with a
role persona in SOUL.md), driven one-shot via `hermes -z`. `dispatch(role, prompt)` returns the
agent's final text. Concurrency-capped (vLLM batches the requests); each call is a FRESH session but
the agent's persisted memory (MEMORY.md, auto-recalled at init) carries learning across tasks.

This is the swarm backend behind the prismpath build flows: "agents propose, gates dispose" — the roles
propose (here, real Hermes agents), the deterministic gate disposes. See [[default-to-swarm-orchestration]].

Setup once:  python -c "import prismpath.hermes_swarm as s; print(s.setup_roles())"
Dispatch:    s.dispatch("coder", "<prompt>")
