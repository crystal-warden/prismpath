"""cli_worker.py — ANY command-line program as a flow worker (the generic subprocess contract).

The engine's worker interface is `worker(node, instruction, state) -> str | dict`. This module
adapts the most stable interface in software — a process with stdin/stdout/exit-code — onto it,
so a Claude/Gemini/aider CLI, a task-file runner, or a shell script can be a node's worker with
no Python written by the flow author. The contract:

  * **stdout is the outcome.** If stdout parses as a JSON object, it becomes the DICT outcome —
    its fields feed `when` predicates directly (`{"text": "…", "tests_pass": true}` routes
    `-> done: when tests_pass` deterministically). Anything else is the outcome TEXT.
  * **Nonzero exit RAISES** (`CliWorkerError`, exit code + stderr tail in the message) — which
    lands on the flow's ERROR TIER: `-> retry: on error when error_count < 3` gives any CLI a
    retry budget and a human-escalation path as *edges in the document*, no wrapper code.
  * **Timeout raises** the same way (`on error when "timeout" in error_message` is routable).
  * **The prompt goes to stdin** (default) — the node's instruction plus a JSON context block —
    or into argv/env via templating, for CLIs that take files or flags instead.

Trust boundary, stated bluntly: a CLI worker is **arbitrary code execution by design** — you are
choosing to run that program, exactly as you choose any worker. prismpath's sandbox claim is about
the ROUTING layer (the `when` predicate evaluator executes no worker-influenced code, ever); it
is not, and cannot be, a claim that your workers are safe. Choose your commands like you choose
your dependencies.

    from prismpath.workers.cli_worker import CliWorker, cli_worker

    # every node runs the same CLI, prompt on stdin:
    worker = cli_worker(["claude", "-p"])

    # or per-node commands, with templating ({node}/{instruction} in args; state via stdin JSON):
    worker = cli_worker({
        "implement": ["md", "tasks/implement.claude.md"],
        "review":    ["md", "tasks/review.gemini.md"],
    }, default=["claude", "-p"])

Engine-heterogeneous routing falls out: different nodes run different engines, and a `when`
predicate on the cheap engine's outcome decides whether its work stands or escalates to the
expensive one — the escalation philosophy lifted one layer up.
