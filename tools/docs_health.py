"""Docs-health lint (Phase 6) + new-work capture audit (Phase 5). Runnable in CI.

Scoped to THIS public repo (not the private sibling dirs, not vendored, not _retired, not gitignored caches):
  1. dead doc-links   — markdown [..](x.md) whose target doesn't resolve
  2. brand residue    — a NEW 'mdflow' self-reference leaking into the docs (post-rename hygiene). The
                        legitimate third-party + interop mentions are allowlisted, so only new leaks flag.
  3. lingering dupes  — normalized-content duplicates still present across canonical repos
  4. task coverage    — each key session task # referenced in SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE/CLAIMS
  5. artifact coverage— each session result artifact referenced in a durable doc
Emits docs_health_report.md; exits 1 on dead links or brand residue (real defects).

#    exit-1 gate) until false-positives are tuned, so no CI regression; promote to a gate later.
