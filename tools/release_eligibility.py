"""PrismPath deciding whether PrismPath's own artifacts are eligible for release.

The acceptance script gathers the facts: which gates ran, which passed, whether the skip budget held,
whether provenance and compatibility verified. This runner reads that report, turns it into one
outcome, and lets the flow in tools/release_policy.md decide: eligible, refused, or missing evidence.
Every edge of the flow is deterministic, so the same policy compiles to a table image, and the image
hash in the receipt is the policy's identity.

The receipt binds the verdict to what it judged: the source revision, the sha256 of each artifact,
the sha256 of the policy flow and of its compiled image, the sha256 of each report the facts came
from, the facts themselves and the path the flow took. It is appended to a Merkle committed audit
log beside the report, so a receipt cannot be altered after the fact without the root changing.

The shell script's exit status stays authoritative during adoption. This verdict is advisory and is
recorded beside it; a defect in the engine cannot certify the engine.
