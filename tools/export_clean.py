"""Generate the lean product mirror of this monorepo.

This repo (crystal-warden/prism-path) is the single source of truth: the full
research, the evidence ledger, the hardware sprints, the OpenTimestamps anchors.
The public product mirror (crystal-warden/prismpath) is a GENERATED subset of it
-- the runnable control plane and its tooling, with the research demoted to a
link. You never hand-edit the mirror; you run this and it is rebuilt, so the two
can never drift and the provenance chain never fragments.

    python tools/export_clean.py --out ../prismpath-clean

By default this only writes the tree and prints a summary. It never inits a git
repo, never commits, never pushes -- creating and publishing the public repo is
a human step. `--commit` will make a local commit in the target if it is already
a git repo; there is deliberately no --push.

What the mirror contains, and what it points elsewhere for, is the MANIFEST
below -- it is meant to be read and adjusted. The one judgement call worth your
eye is HARDWARE / EBPF: by default the down-to-silicon proofs live in the
research repo (the mirror is "install and run"), and the README's portability
pillar links to them there. Flip them into INCLUDE_PREFIXES if you want the
mirror to carry the substrates too.
